volcano detective use artificial intelligence sleuth ancient secret alaska emily schwing smithsoniangetty image emily schwing volcano alaska blew top known novarupta responsible powerful volcanic eruption th century kristi wallace reason care big eruption theyre also one scale biggest hazard biggest impact locally regionallysometimes globally schwing kristi wallace research geologist u geological survey alaska volcano observatory youre enjoying article consider supporting awardwinning journalism subscribing purchasing subscription helping ensure future impactful story discovery idea shaping world today wallace often dont access deep history old history last year glacier wiped everything else away cant study cant really speak biggest eruption history volcano schwing scientist believe theyve found way sleuth deep history volcano novarupta theyre artificial intelligence youre listening scientific american science quickly im emily schwing clip show theme music schwing novarupta dramatically reworked surrounding landscape buried nearby community two foot ash novarupta volcano six mile away another powerful volcano mount katmai wasnt time one volcano proved powerful dramatic volcanic force jordan lubber applied model year ash layer gulf alaska saw katmai responsible producing lot eruption deposit marine core going back year looked almost identical geochemically eruption schwing jordan lubber thirdyear postdoctoral fellow geologist u geological survey ash layer he talking abouttheyre called tephras lubber lot tephra layer gulf alaska dont know came schwing jordan say tephras like volcano fingerprint lubber identify way volcano unique kind geochemical fingerprint use fingerprint apply ash layer dont know source volcano kind better reconstruct longterm volcanic history alaska surrounding region schwing lot large tephraproducing eruption alaska northwestern canada theyre hard get lubber lot location going research volcano accessible road mean either plane helicopter travel something like fieldwork quite challenging guess make u somewhat samplelimited dont dont much information maybe would like volcano dont lot time go boot ground volcano learn schwing there another challenge glacier started retreat end last glacial maximum wiped away evidence large tephraproducing eruption far north think jordan colleague kristi volcano detective trying link tephras source volcano theyre using machine learning aias magnifying glass theyve created model us existing data tephras wallace use machinelearning technique say okay whats erupted last year train model tell u much older deposit come hundred thousand year old potentially link back volcano go back thatlets say katmai one volcano dealing withcan really tell true story volcano schwing finding published november journal geochemistry geophysics geosystems jordan say using ai also mean accurate way differentiate among individual volcano lubber lot lot volcano quite similar human eye like classical statistic might confuse mix thing machine learning basically allows u kind think thing many dimension give data volcano give answer knowlike collected sample volcano know thats erupted come set rule tell u make volcano unique thats really power able better classify unknown eruption schwing jordan kristi say continue training model strengthen accuracy better understand aigenerated answer source volcano inquiry jordan say work like useful alaska surrounding region anywhere volcanic activity known threat public safety lubber volcanic arc slightly different machinelearning model would figure would figure maybe new set rule thats different andes thats different sumatra thats different kamchatka thats different italy proper data handling know good good sort logical test expert expert kind opinion geologist area there reason cant applied elsewhere schwing kristi say new tool could also useful across discipline scientific research community wallace youre looking tephra deposit represent isochron single time history instantaneous fall ground tell time give sense something happened specific time basically link marine record lacustrine record lake terrestrial record help understand know ice age climactic event archaeological time frame people moving around there sort context could put thing schwing context could key new understanding massive eruption like one novarupta changed life people lived wallace first time geochemical data published people working across state even globally access data correlate tephras back location age thats really really powerful
