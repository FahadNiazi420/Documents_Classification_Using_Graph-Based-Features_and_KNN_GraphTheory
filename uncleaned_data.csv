Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:56,https://intothegloss.com/2024/01/arati-sharma-backbone-angels-ghlee-beauty-routine/,"Arati Sharma, Founding Partner, Backbone Angels + Co-Founder, Ghlee",2395,"âI was born in Toronto and then we moved to a suburb called Brampton, which has a huge South Asian population. I always talk about that because it had a huge impact on my life. Growing up, I thought that I might want to do graphic design or something similar because I was artistic. I went to a regional arts high school, but after four years, I didnât want to do it anymore. Honestly, I was always torn between the things that I wanted to do versus the things that I was supposed to doâbut that pressure didnât even come from my parents. At the time, I thought my parents were almost too freewheeling, where sometimes I was like, âCan you give me a little bit of direction?â Now as a parent, I see how amazing that was, but what happened is that I put pressure on myself thinking about how hard it was for them to get here. I took a year off and then later went to university for a poli-sci degree. I loved âThe West Wing,â so I thought Iâd be like C.J. Cregg, dream girl.
CAREER
After university and after a brief stint working at a nonprofit, I ended up at a small tech startup called Jet Cooper. It was a digital design studio that was helping other companies build their mobile apps and websites. This was around the time that tech was the thing, and I really felt like I needed to be a part of it. I was like, âI'm creative. I understand social media. And I kind of understand what's happening in technology.â [Laughs] Actually, thatâs how I met my husband; he was one of the founders. We were just a bunch of young kids then, but I helped him and his co-founder build the agency from the ground up and thatâs how I got to hone my business skills. I figured out our operating model and ran the community aspect. Then Shopify acquired the company, and I went to Shopify. I think I was employee 290.
I got a chance to build a couple of different marketing arms for Shopify from the ground upâI left just three years ago. It was a great experience. I got to set up Kylie Jennerâs first store, I got to launch our first product conference. The company always created space for me to get my hands dirty. But after being there for almost eight years, it was time to do something else. I kept thinking, âWhatâs happening outside of e-commerce?â
That same year, I helped found Backbone Angels, a collective of angel investors. Angel investing is very common when you're a tech employee, especially when you've gone through an IPO. Usually, the early employees end up investing in other companies, but usually, the investors that you hear about are all the dudes. Even if you look at my husband, when Shopify went public, everyone was asking him to angel invest. The 10 of us at Backbone Angels are all women who were with the company since the early days, but whereas the men were asked to invest, we were just asked to be mentors or speak on a panel or support founders. I kept thinking, âWait, this is not how wealth is generated.â We came together with the idea that we wanted to invest in the founders that we wanted to see in the world, so our focus is on women and non-binary foundersâand for me personally, my emphasis lies on women of color. Over time, Iâve become an accidental DTC investor. I have brands like Blume, Sheertex, SIDIA, and Bird&Be in my portfolio.

When my brother, Varun [Sharma], pitched me the idea for Ghlee, our ghee-based skincare line, I thought I had seen every type of skincare brand at that point. But he was like, âWhy donât we use ghee? Our elders have used it inside and out for ages. Why hasnât anyone formulated with it?â Six months after Varun pitched me, he came to me with a lip balm prototype. I have the worst chapped lips, but when I tried the product, it worked like nothing else I had ever used. At first, my mom and dad were making the ghee, and our sister came on to help with sales. It was a cute little family operation. We seeded the product to a lot of people, got amazing feedback, and then went through a lab and a chemist to launch.
When we first created Ghlee, our first couple iterations of our lip balms had the same texture as our lip mask. They were very creamy but very hard to keep stable in the applicatorsâbut people were obsessed with them. When we did our user test, people would say, âI want it in a vat. I want it on my cuticles. I want it on my hands. I want it on my face.â We did stabilize the lip balms because we, of course, didnât want them to melt all over the place, but then we decided to build something for the OGs that wanted the product in a jar. We added squalane and kahai oil to it, and it became our mask.
Our lip scrub also has ghee in it, of course. Growing up, I used Vaseline and a toothbrush to exfoliate my lips, so when we started Ghlee, we wanted a really gentle lip scrub. Iâm always annoyed when scrubs are too harsh. We went with cane brown sugar, which is a very big Indian thing. The cane exfoliates while the ghee moisturizes, so the scrub isnât drying in any way.
SKINCARE
I had acne growing up, but honestly, my skin was great in my twenties so I was lazy with it. Then all of a sudden after I had my child, I had crazy rosacea flare-ups on my right cheek, and thatâs when I had to really start taking care of my skin again. A friend of mine went through the same thing after she had her first child and Pai Skincare seemed to really help her. Iâve adopted some of their products into my own routine since.
Some hyaluronic acid serums are too thick on my skin, but I really like Paiâs Lotus & Hyaluronic Acid Barrier Defence Mist. Itâs really great when my rosacea is acting up. Common Heirâs Vitamin C Serum comes in single-dose capsules, which I love because so many vitamin C serums come in clear bottles with droppers, so the product oxidizes every time you open it up. Ranavatâs Brightening Saffron Serum has similar properties to vitamin C. It really helps with hyperpigmentation. When I stopped using it for two months, my skin definitely looked more dull. Itâs South Asian-founded, too. The serum has a high price point, and saffron is obviously a very expensive ingredient, but you also never see our things as luxe. I love that the founder, Michelle Ranavat, is elevating our POV.

To cleanse, I love Biologique Rechercheâs Lait E.V., but I feel like it leaves behind a film on my skin. Sahajanâs Golden Milk Cleanser has the milky texture of the Lait E.V. without the film. Meanwhile, CaudalÃ­eâs Beauty Elixir has been a consistent empty in my routine for 10 years. I always have an extraâif I stop using it, I break out.
Tower 28 is such a great brand overallâI discovered it through the SOS Rescue Spray. Then I tried the SOS Rescue Serum, and I remember thinking it was the serum Iâve waited for all of my life. Itâs light. Itâs clear. It really does have an impact on redness. Itâs so hard to believe marketing when youâre in this industry yourself, but Tower 28 is dead on. My pores even look tighter after I use it.
Water-based moisturizersâlike Tatchaâs Water Cream and Peter Thomas Rothâs Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Creamâare it for me. I love that theyâre light because I like to layer an oilâlike Blume Meltdown Acne Oilâon top, especially at nighttime. In the winter, I really like True Botanicalsâ Renew Pure Radiance Oil. I discovered the brand when I had a facial in California that used just True Botanicals products. My skin was unbelievable afterwards. Their Neck, DÃ©colletÃ© & Boob Cream is also very good. Iâve also tried every sunscreen on the market, but Iâve consistently used Elta MDâs Tinted SPF 46. I always have one in my bag. Itâs light. It works with my skin tone. Itâs my go-to.
Iâm a big fan of exfoliating. Every once in a while, Iâll use Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel Pads. If I want an exfoliating mask, I go for AAVRANIâs Glow Activating Exfoliator. Itâs a clay mask thatâs turmeric-infused. I run really hot, and I love that it feels cool on my skin. And I discovered Alumierâs Retinol Resurfacing Serum 1.0 through Joanna Auguste, the founder of The Face Lab. I wasnât a big retinol gal before, but this one is really good. It has really helped with my crowâs feet.
Iâm turning 38 this year. Overall, Iâm not opposed to any surgeries, but theyâre not for me right now. That said, Iâve tried Botox. I first got it on my massaters because I grind my teeth so hard. When I got it done, I actually realized how much tension I was holding in my jaw, and it kind of changed my lifeâI felt so relaxed. After that, I got Botox in my forehead because I have the most expressive face. And I love Forma, the radiofrequency treatment. It really tightens my skin.

MAKEUP
Iâm very minimal when it comes to makeup because I have a slight silicone allergy. If I wear a lot of makeup, Iâll get pretty bad milia. Iâve tried non-silicone foundations, but those donât blend as well. I usually end up using Vasantiâs Liquid VO2 all over my face.
When youâre a brown girl, you deal with hyperpigmentation. I have really dark, indented eye circles, and I feel like Iâve tried every concealer on the market. Kulfi Beautyâs Main Match Concealer is the only one that doesnât end up creasing. I have a couple of shades that I rotate and mix depending on how tan I am, but I usually end up using Mango Drop and Glossy Guaba.
Patrick Taâs CrÃ¨me & Powder Blush Duo in She's That Girl was practically made for brown girls. Itâs so good on my skin. I like the peachy glow a lot. I donât typically wear cream blushes because they tend to melt on me, but this is perfect, especially with the combination of the powder.
I was very intimidated by highlighter for a long time, but I love how Ami ColÃ©âs Light Catching Highlighter looks on my skin. It gives me a sort of golden glow that really works for meâI think maybe the issue with other highlighters is that the colors were too cool. I love their Lash-Amplifying Mascara, too. Oh, and the Lip Treatment Oil is so good. Iâm learning how to line my lips correctly. [Laughs] Honestly, I go through phases with lipstickâI love a bright red like Gucciâs Velvet Matte Lipstick in Odalie Red. But right now, I like more of a gloss vibe. Iâve been using Meritâs Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil in Pink Beet, a cool pink.
HAIR
Iâm Indian. We care about our hair. Weâre always oiling it. Your momâs oiling it. Your grandmaâs doing it to her mom. I love Fable and Maneâs HoliRoots Hair Oil. I use it as a pre-wash, too. Iâm a try-everything-gal, so I donât have a go-to shampoo, but for conditioner, Iâve been using Bumble and bumbleâs Bond-Building Repair Conditioner. Once a week, Iâll use Briogeoâs Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo because my hair gets congested easily.
My hair is naturally very wavy, but I got into a bad habit of constantly straightening it because I didnât know what to do with it. Now Iâm trying to regain my curl pattern so Iâve been air drying my hair after I put Ceremoniaâs Pequi Curl Activator on when itâs damp.

FRAGRANCE
Iâm into really fresh scentsâeverything else gives me a headache. I was a Le Labo Santal 33 girl for a really long time, but then it felt too heavy for me. Right now, my scent is Diptyqueâs Philosykos. Scent changes on my end, as it does for everybody, and I really love how Philosykos comes through. I love Glossier You, too. I usually use the Solid, but I just got the Rollerball and I always have it on meâitâs the one that always gets me the most compliments.
Kilianâs Roses On Ice is my going out perfume and D.S. & Durgaâs Radio Bombay is nostalgic. It makes me feel like Iâm in India. Itâs so beautiful. I especially love using it during the winter. But I love D.S. & Durga candles even more than their perfumes. Theyâre all over my house. Concrete After Lightning, Big Sur After Rain, and Portable Fireplace are amazing.
I love what Erin Kleinberg is doing with her brand SIDIA for the body and hand care categories. Iâm so concerned about my hands lately where Iâm like, âOh my God. Why are they drying up?â Iâm noticing fine lines around them, so I really like her Hand Serum. But SIDIA candles are amazing. Wired and Braless are named so correctly. I have Braless in my bedroom, and I kid you not, after a long day of meetings or if Iâve had a crazy mom day, I light it and take off my bra and Iâm like, âNo one talk to me. Iâm going to watch Housewives.â Itâs like Pavlovâs dog.â

Spiderlike Mars Robot Might One Day Crawl through Unexplored Volcanic Caves
This eight-legged probe would scour Marsâs underground lava tubes for places where explorers might campâor for signs of past life

A robot designed in the spiderlike image of a âdaddy longlegsâ may be on its way to help scientists explore the next frontier on Mars: caves. A partial prototype of the machine, called ReachBot, has demonstrated its ability to grasp the uneven walls of a natural cavern in Californiaâs Mojave Desert, as described in a study published Wednesday in Science Robotics.
The tests show that ReachBotâs unique gripping mechanism and arachnid configuration may be useful for extraterrestrial spelunking. âIf you really want to explore all over the inside of a [Martian] cave, ReachBot is going to be hard to beat,â says senior study author Mark Cutkosky, a mechanical engineering professor at Stanford University.
Six rovers have already successfully landed on Mars, but much of the planet remains unexploredâincluding its caves and lava tubes, underground corridors formed by molten rock. âThe subsurface has never really been examined, other than seismic measurements and penetrating radar,â says Wolfgang Fink, an associate professor of engineering and Edward and Maria Keonijan Endowed Chair at the University of Arizona, who was not involved in the ReachBot research. Some astrobiologists think this extensive subterranean network could be the Martian locale most likely to harbor signatures of past or present alien life. Caves might also be potential sites for human habitation.

Navigating irregular, unmapped and descending terrain 140 million miles from Earth would clearly require some highly specialized equipment. Other robots proposed for Martian cave exploration include the caninelike, four-legged NeBula-SPOT and the Descent and Exploration in Deep Autonomy of Lava Underground Structures (DEADALUS) device, which would hang into a pit on a tether from a surface rig. A grasping machine such as ReachBot, Fink says, might offer a few advantagesâsuch as the ability to access walls and ceiling areas beyond the reach of ground-based rovers or short-range flying drones. ReachBotâs strong limbs could also potentially drill core samples and execute other forceful tasks.
To build something that can traverse a large area and still be lightweight and maneuverable, Cutkosky and his colleagues found inspiration in arachnidsâspecifically, long-legged spider cousins called harvestmen, aka daddy longlegs. ReachBot has a small central body and up to eight appendages. Those limbs, or booms, can be rigid or rolled up, like a metal measuring tape. (In small-scale lab tests, the engineers used ordinary tape measures as stand-ins for the much more expensive carbon-fiber material that would be used in space.)
At the end of each boom is a three-fingered gripper equipped with âmicrospines,â made from sewing needles, that help the bot firmly grasp rough rock. These grippers stabilize the robot by maintaining uniform tension across each boom, a function Cutkosky likens to âspokes on a bicycle wheel.â Cameras and sensors on the central body and the grippers enable ReachBot to perceive its surroundings and choose where to place its mechanical hands. The slow-moving bot is designed to advance methodically by detaching and relocating one boom at a time, while the central body shifts position as booms extend and retract.
âFrom a pure robotics point of view, this is a really great idea,â Fink says. He has reservations, though, about how a robot as complex as ReachBot might hold up in a Martian cave, where a lot can go wrong and repairs are difficult. âOne would almost prefer something simpler,â he says, pointing to the beach ballâesque Tumbleweed rover concept design from NASAâs Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Minimizing fragility and managing the moving parts are ongoing concerns, Cutkosky says, but he notes that some protective redundancy is built into ReachBot; one or two damaged limbs would not prevent it from functioning. Michelle Rosen, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and a robotics researcher uninvolved in the new study, also sees the value of eight appendages. âRedundancy like that is a really good thing, especially when youâre thinking about planetary exploration,"" she says, adding that the proof-of-concept work was âsuper compelling.â
ReachBot's three-fingered gripper firmly grasps handholds in cave walls.
BDML Stanford University
In 2023 lead study author Tony Chen, a robotics expert at Stanford University, hiked through the Mojave Desert with some of his co-researchers to a lava tube chosen for its likely similarities to Martian caves. There they ran tests with a single-boom version of ReachBot mounted on a tripod to see how well it could identify grip points on the lava tubeâs walls. The perception system âworked really wellâ to home in on suitable robot handholds, Chen says. And the botâs boom and gripper mechanism performed as hoped, reaching for those points with a secure grip.
But one thing the team hadnât planned for was the sheer volume of magnetic dust present inside the lava tube. The ferrous crud didnât disable ReachBot during three days of testing, but âso much dust accumulated inside the robotâ that this may pose a longer-term problem, Chen notes. Future designs will have to deal with such intrusions, especially if a machine like ReachBot is destined for a distant, dusty world. âWeâre still quite far away from actually being on Mars,â Chen says. Itâs one small grasp for a robot prototype on Earth, hinting at a leap in our knowledge of what lies beneath other planets.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:48,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/marta-mae-dieux-air-milkshake-beauty/,"Marta Mae, Co-Founder, Dieux + Air Milkshake",2873,"âIâm really good at manifesting. When I was growing up in South Jersey, I always knew that I wanted to work in the fashion industry. I was a girly girlâI never wore pants, only dresses, skirts, skortsâand I had this dream of going to the Fashion Institute of Technology. I didnât even do a campus tour when I applied in high school. I ended up studying textile development because Iâm a fabric nerd. After college, I did work in research and development for the first five or six years of my career. I interned at Betsey Johnson, which was iconic because I got to work with the actual Betsey Johnson. And then later I worked for Alice + Olivia, The Jones Group, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Express.
My mom passed away when I was doing R&D for Polo Ralph Laurenâs sleepwear. My boss at the time was going on maternity leave, so I wasnât offered a proper bereavement and was forced to come back to work the day after the funeral. I thought, âFuck this. Fashionâs not for me. I canât believe that making pajamas is more important than a 23-year-old grieving her mother.â I really started to take stock of what was important to me. A few months later, I felt like I needed a creative outlet and a community to keep me going, so I started an Instagram called Hot Girls Eating Pizza in the spring of 2014. I would ask cool women I admired to get pizza. I would literally DM them on Instagram and take them out during my lunch breaks or after work. Over the course of the last decade, I had hundreds and hundreds of pizza dates, which shaped my career and also some of my closest friendships. I met Charlotte Palermino, who co-founded Itâs Nice Paper and Dieux with me, through a Hot Girls Eating Pizza date. Dieux specifically came out of an opportunity we saw for a transparent skincare company. Charlotte, Joyce [de Lemos], and I launched Dieux with our Forever Eye Masks in September of 2020 and then released our Deliverance Soothing Serum the following year.
My gifting suite Air Milkshake is the evolution of Hot Girls Eating Pizza. I was introduced to so many people and so many brands through HGEP, and pre-pandemic, I ran some gifting programs for a few brands. I realized there was a big opportunity to take the pizza away and focus on the amazing community I had built and introduce them to new products, brands, and people in a really intentional way. At this point, Iâve worked with some pretty large brands, like Vans and Leviâs. Iâve also worked with brands like Hill House, Vacation, K18, Casper, Fly By Jing, and Houseplant, Seth Roganâs cannabis company. Iâve had some bad experiences going to other gifting suites where people were judged for how many followers they had. Iâve always believed in micro-influencers and investing in real people who have an engaged community versus just large followings, so the people invited to Air Milkshakes are not always influencers in the âtraditionalâ sense. I have people that come in with 2,000 followers, and I know that their ROI is so much more long-term than a flash in the pan influencer.
I also have a cannabis and lifestyle brand called Angel Therapy with my fiancÃ© Lincoln Barnett and a couple of our friends. Lincoln has worked in cannabis his whole career, and Iâve always wanted to own a weed company. We started it in 2021 and licensed it in both California and New York City. Itâs just a fun project right now, but Iâm excited to see how it evolves.

SKINCARE
I get facials one to two times a month with Hayat Moubarak at LA Clinic BH or with Cynthia Franco, and I go to FaceGym two to four times a month. I love Kate Rose Teitelbaum in the Santa Monica location and Brooke in the West Hollywood spot. If I have an event coming up, Iâll go every week. Iâve also been getting cosmetic acupuncture from Dr. Toni Weinrit at The Reset: LA. Sheâs fucking amazing. I was on a 10-week plan with her, which included microneedling every four weeks. After those sessions, I used Sofie Pavitâs Nice Ice Frozen Toner Pods to help with redness. The next day, I glowed like nothing else.
Dr. Lorettaâs Gentle Hydrating Cleanser is my favorite cleanser. Iâve been using it for four years now. The smell is so light and it foams up so nicely. To make sure that I get everything off my face, especially when Iâve worn makeup, Iâll follow up with a toner. Iâve used the Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2 my whole life, but if I donât grab that one, then Iâm reaching for OdacitÃ©âs Blue Aura Cleansing Water.
Our Dieux Deliverance is my holy grail serum. I am so grateful to have an unlimited supply because I use it very generously, multiple times a day. Itâs very calming, so itâs great if you have any sort of irritation. Meanwhile, the Saro de RÃºe Freeze Dried Hyaluronic Acid System is fucking amazing too. My friend at Violet Grey gifted it to me a year and a half ago. I wasnât using hyaluronic acid at the time, but I started to pair the tablets with Deliverance instead of the Pure Activator that it comes with and the results were crazy. My skin was so hydrated. I only use the tablets a couple of times a week since the system is pretty expensive, but itâs such a neat and innovative concept. Sofie Pavittâs Mandelic Clearing Serum is also fantasticâit really stops a breakout in its tracks.
Iâve been saying that our Dieux Air Angel is my favorite since it launched, but I always go back to our Dieux Instant Angel. I might be biased, but I really think that itâs one of the best moisturizers in the world. I use it liberally and it doesnât pill, even under my tinted moisturizer. Otherwise, I really love Cliniqueâs Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. Itâs the product Iâve used the longest throughout my life. My mom was such a Clinique freakâone of my earliest memories is of her taking me to the Clinique counter to get a re-up on her Clarifying Lotion 2.

I had a crazy bout of hormonal acne when I turned 28, and it fucking sucked. My chin was especially bad, and I was so grateful for the Starface Pimple Patches. They really helped my confidence. My skin is much better now, but when I have a spot thatâs healing, I always reach for the OdacitÃ© Le Blue Repair Balm. It really cuts down on healing time.
I was introduced to Agent Nateur through Air Milkshake. The Holi (Bright) Resurface Glass Face Mask is especially good. Itâs gentle enough that you can wear it overnight and itâs really helped to even out my skin tone. The only other face mask Iâve been using is Sisleyâs Black Rose Cream. My aesthetician Hayat worked with Sisley for 30 yearsâshe was the one who put me on it. Itâs really expensive, but I understand why because itâs fucking goodâitâs so hydrating.
When it comes to sunscreen, I love Nivea Japanâs Super Water Gel SPF 50 PA+++. It was a Sofie Pavitt recommendation from a few years ago, but itâs been my favorite since. Itâs such a nice watery formula that goes on like a serum. The Dr. Loretta Urban Antioxidant Sunscreen SPF 40 goes on really well, too. I always have one in my purse.
I try to use the FaceGym Pure Lift Facial Skincare Tool every night. Their facialists use it during treatments, and I feel like itâs stronger than any other device Iâve used. That said, I also really like the ZIIP Microcurrent Facial Device. I got a facial with the founder, Melanie Simon, over the summer, and it was so cool to have her show me tips and tricks to use it. Instead of the ZIIP Conductive Gel though, I actually use the Lily of the Desert Inner Fillet Aloe Vera Gel for treatments. And then I was given a Current Body LED Face Mask over the summer. Nowadays, I donât have an extra 20 or 30 minutes to use it every night, but when I use it consistently, I do see a big difference. Iâve also been sleeping with Frownies Non-Invasive Wrinkle Smoothers every night for the past monthâI buy the Gentle Lifts for Lip Lines but use them all over my face. Theyâre these little adhesive patches that you wet with water and stick on your face, and I swear, my fine lines are disappearing before my eyes. You look crazy when you go to bed, but I think theyâre magic.

MAKEUP
My cheeks get really red very easily. Iâve learned to embrace my natural flush, so to that end, Iâve never had to use blush. I always default to either a glitter eye or winged cat eyeâthatâs a skill that Iâm proud of. Iâve tried to learn how to do smoky eye a few times, but then Iâm always like, âWhen are you actually going to use this?â
Iâve been using the Tarte Amazonian Clay BB Tinted Moisturizer in Medium-Tan for maybe a decade. It really enhances my natural color, and my cheek color still comes throughâI just look more âaliveâ when I wear it. I also like that it has a little bit of SPF, but at this point in my life, I know that itâs not enough to wear it on its own, so I do wear sunscreen underneath it, too. If I need more coverage or have to cover any pimples, I like the NARS Soft Matte Complete Concealer in Custard.
I get my brows tinted and laminated with Yuki at Salon Lepetie, but in between sessions, I like to use the Half Magic Grippie Brow Sculpting Brow Gel for a feathered look. Growing up, I didnât listen to my mom when she said that brows are so important, so I over-plucked mine. Iâve tried to grow them out with a serum, but itâs just so hard to remember to put it on every night. I just draw in little hairs with the Victoria Beckham Babyblade Brow Pencil in the few bald spots that I canât get rid of. I usually have a hard time finding the right brow pencil shade because my eyebrows are on the lighter end, but VBBâs Taupe is perfect for me. And then my friend Jade put me onto the Babe Original Pro Lash Separator. Because my lashes are lifted and tinted, I would use disposable separators a lot, which I felt so bad about. The Babe one is just $10, perfectly curves around your whole eye, and truly separates your lashes. Itâs amazing.
I was so loyal to Kat Von Dâs Tattoo Eyeliner and Stilaâs Liquid Liner for years, but I was gifted the Trish McEvoy Liquid Liner Pen and Iâve been loving it this past year. If I donât use a dark liner though, Iâll use the Victoria Beckham Beauty Brightening Waterline Pencil instead. Itâs such a cool product. Itâs kind of a throwback to the white eyeliner we would use back in the day, but it really makes your eyes pop.
Victoria Beckham Beauty also makes these great shadow sticks called Eyewear. Theyâre super pigmented and blend out really well. Macaroon is such a beautiful pink. I love Oyster, a shimmery pearl, too. I blend them out with my fingers. And Iâve been using the Stila Glitter & Glow Shadows since college. Smoky Storm and Gold Goddess are so pretty, and they just glide on. The About-Face Shadowsticks are so easy to use, too. Acidic, an acid green, and 2002, a pearly blue, are my favorite shades. Iâll either do a wing with them or just color in my entire eye and head out the door.
For my lips, Victoria Beckhamâs Posh Glosses in Ice, the clear shade, and Fizz, a cool rose, are my favorites. Then I top off whatever Iâm wearing with the Caliray Surfproof Setting Spray. I obviously donât wear a lot of makeup, but itâs so nice to have a spray on hand, especially for eye makeup.

NAILS
I go to Zoe at Red Polish for my nails every four weeks. Julie Schott introduced me to her over the pandemic, so Iâve been going to her for three or four years now. She does the best nail art. At this point, she and I have the type of relationship where if I donât have a concept in mind, Iâll say, âZoe, itâs your call today.â Iâm always so happy with the results. Iâm very girly with my nails though. I love clouds, sparkles, glitter, and hearts.
FRAGRANCE
I had a party to celebrate 10 years of Hot Girls Eating Pizza, and as I was hugging some of my friendsâsome of whom I havenât seen in five or six yearsâthey said, âYou smell like you.â Itâs because Iâve worn the same scent since college: ChloÃ© Eau De Parfum. I love how it smells on me, and Iâve gotten so many compliments on it over the years that Iâll probably never switch. Recently, Iâve been layering it with D.S. & Durgaâs I Donât Know What. I also like to layer it with Milk from DedCool. And thereâs this incredible fragrance and candle studio in Brooklyn called Joya. They do the coolest collaborations in the game, including a roll on perfume oil with an experiential hotel in Nashville called Noelle. Sometimes I layer that on, too. It smells like amber and musk, which I tend to gravitate towards.
I get more experimental with fragrance when it comes to candles, but one of my more classic favorites is Maison Louis Marieâs No.04 Bois de Balincourt. It smells so clean. I discovered it at New York Pilates because they always burn itâand I have a really positive association with going to NYP and taking time for myself. I also love all of Joyaâs candles, but especially Nightlight, which is their collab with artist Tom Fruin. And my friends have this amazing one-of-one candle brand called Western Disco. They source vessels and make candles with their signature scents, Seabird and Orchard.

HAIR
Jess Gonzalez colors my hair at Benjamin LA. Iâve been going to her for highlights every three months for a year and a half, and I love the way they grow out when Jess does them. Sheâs somehow able to do them without damaging my hair. For trims and blowouts, I go to Nina Aprileâshe has been on a journey with me to get my hair to grow long again. I do a trim with her every three months now, and itâs finally growing long again. I only get three or four blowouts a year nowâand always with Nina. I used to get them so often, but my hair was just not in a good place so I mainly air dry now. Ninaâs blowouts are my favorite in the world though. She also has an amazing hair brand called That Girl That Did Your Hair. We included her Knotty Brushes in the Air Milkshake suite in New York. I think theyâre better than Tangle Teezers. Theyâre the perfect brushes for smoothing and de-tangling.
I love purple shampoos, but I try not to overdo it with them because I donât want my hair to get too ashy. Itâs really easy to get a little brassy in California though, so I throw a purple shampoo in the mix every third hair wash. Kevin Murphyâs Blonde.Angel.Wash is great. dpHUE also makes an incredible Cool Blonde Shampoo and Conditioner. Jess put me on to the Milbon Moisture Replenishing #6 Treatment, which I use every week. Thatâs what she uses when she colors my hair. It makes a huge difference with moisture, and I love Milbon in general. California Naturals Shampoo and Conditioner are also in the mix.
I love Agent Nateurâs Holi (Locks) Strengthening Serum and Hair (Silk) Hydrating Serum. I really credit Holi (Locks) especially with helping me grow my hair. Itâs an oil that you massage into your scalp. I think the stimulation has been really helpful. I also have an iRestore Essential red light hair mask thatâs been really helpful with hair growth and preventing hair loss. I was losing so much hair from stress, and Stacey Bendet, the founder of Alice & Olivia posted about it on Instagram. I was totally influenced. I use it for 30 minutes every day.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:54,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/bronzer-101/,Bronzers Made Easy,977,"If youâve ever been confused about bronzersâwhat theyâre supposed to do, how youâre supposed to choose one, and where the heck youâre supposed to apply themâwell, of course you have. Bronzers are weirdly confusing. And it doesnât help that in the past decade or so that theyâve risen in popularity alongside contouring products, which are vaguely similar to bronzers, but also very different! Then thereâs the matter of finding the right shade, and also the right formulaâ¦ Well today, makeup artist Harold James is here to help. The Paris-based bronzer wizard walked ITG through the ins and outs of adding warmth to any complexion.
First, figure out what you want overall
People get tripped up over bronzers for a lot of reasons, but confusion over whether or not youâre supposed to contour with a bronzer is probably number one. So letâs set this for the record once and for all: bronzers are purely meant to add warmth to your skin, and they are not contouring products! The big difference is that contouring formulas, with their cooler tones, are meant to obscure parts of the face. As a result, they sculpt definition. âContour mimics the shadows of your face,â explains Harold. âYou can't use a bronzer to create shadow because most bronzers have too much warmth.â Bronzers enhance the parts of your face where light hits almost in the same way a highlighter does, but instead of adding luminosity, it adds a layer of rich, sun-kissed heat.
Then, pick up the right shade
Harold says that âfinding your shade is very personalâ because you first have to decide how âwarmâ youâd like to look. Going for a subtle sun-kissed glow? A bronzer one to two shades darker than your foundation is good for an everyday level of warmth. If youâre angling to fake a day at the beach, try two to three shades darker. But youâre going to have to experiment no matter what, because this really isnât a hard and fast rule. And please, please try to ignore viral bronzer tutorials that come across your screen. âSocial media is a different world because you need a much darker bronzer to translate through the camera,â explains Harold. âWhen it's too dark in real life, it can look very harsh.â
Andâ¦the right formula
Youâll want to avoid traditional cream formulas if youâre a bronzer newbie, since those tend to be more pigmented and allow less room for user error. Instead, go for liquid or gel-creams because they are âeasy to blend,â says Harold. Itâs OK to stick with a powder bronzer if youâre super oilyâ¦but the most important thing to consider for either of these formulas is to start small and build up as needed. Harold says âWhen you do that, itâs nearly impossible to mess up.â
Apply bronzer using this techniqueâ¦
OK, so you have your bronzer in-hand. Now, itâs time to apply it. Harold says he prefers to paint pigment on with his fingers. âWhen you warm up the texture in your hands, it's even easier to blend it out.â Like Harold said before, start with a very small amount, and then see how that blends into your overall look. After that first pass, Harold likes to deepen the coverage with a Beautyblender. âIf you want even more control and coverage, you can use a dense brush instead.â Make sure you donât go overboard. âThere's such a misconception that you should apply a lot of bronzer, but that looks awful,â says Harold. âIn the beginning it's really satisfying, but in the end it will dry down patchy.â
â¦And this roadmap
Where the sun hits your face is your ultimate bronzer roadmap. Start with the foreheadâHarold likes to dot the hairline with pigment. Then he moves down the face, where he dots pigment right on top of the cheekbones. Overall, you want bronzer to be âvery blended and hidden,â explains Harold. âSometimes I like to add bronzer on top of the nose for extra warmth, and also down on the chest. That especially gives this sensual and seamless look.â
But wait! Letâs talk about makeup order of operations for a moment
Harold says it best: âIf you want the bronzer to be soft, you apply it before foundation. We call that underpainting. Let it dry, and then you apply the foundation. The result is a very diffused, sun-kissed look. If you want more control and want it to be more precise, do it after the foundation, but before the blush. It gives more dimension to the face. This is very good when you have to take pictures.â
Now try it the Parisian way
âIn France they love terracottaâthatâs what they call bronzers,â says Harold. âYou have to have it, otherwise you look sad.â Women will wear nothing but bronzer and lipstick, but, he adds, âthis is very serious.â When it comes to Parisians and bronzers, âit can't be too orange.â
Or not! Up to you
The best thing about bronzers is their versatility. There are only so many places you can wear blush, for example. But bronzers? Skyâs the limit. âThe ultimate goal is to bring warmth,â Harold reiterates. That could really be anywhere on your face. Even as a base on your lids. âIt brings such beautiful depth there.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:55,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/chloe-fineman-saturday-night-live-beauty-routine/,"Chloe Fineman, Comedian, Saturday Night Live",2299,"âI grew up in Berkeley, California and had an eclectic, Bohemian childhood. Growing up, I wanted to be an actress and a dancer. I wanted to be Meryl Streep, basically, so I ended up going to the Tisch School at NYU. Comedy wasnât in my mind at all. After graduating, I moved to Los Angeles to be an actor and kind of failed at it. When I found the Groundlings, an improv group, I didnât know a lot of people; I was doing improv purely to make friends. In class, I got the suggestion to do Drew Barrymore, and afterwards, everyone was like, âWhoa.â Around that time, Instagram was starting up, and people were starting to put stuff out, and that was that. I made a video compilation to audition for Saturday Night Live and the team liked mine. Then I did a showcase in LA. Ben Affleck was thereânot to bragâand it went well. Then I flew out to New York and tested. The first time I tested, it was me, Bowen Yang, Ego Nwodim, Lauren Holt, and people who wanted to be writers. I auditioned twice and got it.
BEAUTY
Iâve always been into beauty in a crazy way. Cindy Crawford used to have these workout videos, and I was obsessed with them. I used to draw a beauty mark on my face. In high schoolâthis is so toxicâI remember using a brown Sharpie. And then Iâd cover my face with lipstick. I mean, people wore lip gloss at school already, but I was like, ""No, weâre doing lipstick. Huzzah!â Then I remember when people started plucking their eyebrows, I was like, âUgh, too much work.â I went into my momâs bathroomâor maybe I used my dadâs razorâand I shaved my brows right down the middle. I looked like a clown for a while.
SNL and beauty really go hand in hand in a big way. If your script gets picked, you get to decide the wigs and the costumes and the makeup. I will say, it can be a bit of a nightmare for meâI literally cut my hair recently because I had a short wig on during a Weekend Update. Plus, the art of what looks funny versus pretty is always a fine line to walk. Iâm always referencing Absolutely Fabulous, which is a British show from the â90s. Itâs incredible and my favorite thing ever. It features these two women that I always look to for wig inspo. For a recent skit, which got cut, I was trying to have a frazzled wig, but the wig looked too hot. [Laughs] By the way, I still keep my wigs in my oven. If Iâm making my sweet potatoes, I take them out.

TREATMENTS
I'm in my thirties, which means Iâm at peak med spa mistake age. It all turned dark during COVID. When they lifted enough restrictions in LA, I was like âThis is the time to get Botox, because no one will see me for probably six months.â But then I couldnât lift my forehead until right when we came back to workâand for comedy and acting, you want to be able to move your face. Also, being around other women my age at work, and in New York in general, everyoneâs like, âOh, you should do thisâ or âYouâve got to go here.â I wanted to get a laser treatment before the first Met Gala I went to, and then next thing I knew I accidentally did Fraxel and couldnât leave the house for seven days. Another time I wanted a subtle change in my lips, but then they became swollen and way out there. Every six months, I feel like I tell [my makeup artist] Marc Reagan, âSorry, I made a mistake. Whoops.â That said, Linda Behla is my favorite ever at Hayes Valley Medical Esthetics. Sheâs heaven. Iâve been going to her for years. I got Emsculpt last summer at Hayes, and itâs crazy what it did to my abs. Dr. Lara Devgan is my favorite for subtle treatments. I once got the tiniest amount of filler in my lips, and I didnât bruise. They werenât swollen either. I told her, âYouâre a wizard.â
SKINCARE
Tracie Martynâs Amla cleanser is generally great, and Tata Harperâs oil cleanser is great for removing makeup. Itâs probably the one I use the most. I donât think people realize how much makeup weâre wearing on SNLâitâs like a newscasterâs amount of makeup. Honestly, smell is number one for me. I like anything that reminds me of Berkeleyâclean and hippie and natural. If thatâs a part of anything Iâm putting on my face, I feel good. Living Libationsâs Best Skin Ever Seabuckthorn has my favorite scent ever.
Iâve used Biologique Recherche P50 maybe three times. Iâm afraid of it. Everyoneâs like, âThe purge! The purge!â And I donât want to purge. But Kate Berlant, the host of Poog, which is my favorite podcast ever for all things, said itâs important, so I do have it and I look at it. Tracie Martyn has a good toner too, but Iâm just not that good about it. Joanna Vargasâs Vitamin C Skin Rescue isnât scary, nor does it smell like pennies and ham. If everything is just light and actually smells good, Iâll put it on my face no matter whatâbut the stuff that supposedly changes your life stinks. Like, to put P50 and then ham oil on top of it is really tough. I even hate sunscreen because I hate the smell.

I love U Beautyâthatâs a big one for me. The founder, Tina Chen Craig, is iconic. I met her on a fashion trip and she told us she had a skincare line. We tried it and then were all like, âThis is the best thing ever.â Her stuff is so simple that I go to it frequently. I love the Resurfacing Compound, I throw on the Super Hydrator, and I love the Intensive Face Oil that she just came out with. To me, thatâs easy. Done. And while I do think Augustinus Baderâs Rich Cream is worth the money, I will say that the moisturizer I return to when my skin is dry is Kat Burkiâs Vitamin C Intensive Face Cream. Iâve been using it for years and years. Itâs delicious. I have one at work. I have one at home. I like to keep it in the refrigerator, and it feels so good when I put it on.
MAKEUP
I donât want to walk around with makeup on me, so I have it all in my dressing room. I love to slap on some Jones Road Miracle BalmâI have all of the shadesâand Tata Harper Cream Blush in Peachy. U Beauty and Macrene both have tinted moisturizers that I love; I use shade 02 and Light-Medium respectively. U Beautyâs is unbelievable. It gives you a beautiful glow. Itâs sort of like the Westman Atelier Complexion Drops, which are great but too oily for me.
When it comes to brows, I get mine tinted. In New York, I go to Azi Sacksâsheâs a character. I love texting her, and being like, âHey, when can I come in?â Sheâs like, âApril 2026.â Anytime I see her, itâs probably because she had a cancellation. In LA, I used to go to Striiike, but now, I just go to Michelle Holmes for the same feathered brow look. Sheâs so lovely and talented and has a great brow serum called Rye. I use it all the time. She was the one who got me hooked on the Obagi brow serum, which has made my brows amazing and changed my life. Itâs magic. Still, I like to fill them in with an Anastasia Beverly Hills pencilâI like all of them but especially Brow Wizâin Taupe. I curl my lashes with the Kevyn Aucoin eyelash curler, and then I love all of Kevyn Aucoinâs mascaras. Tom Ford and Makeup by Mario have amazing neutral eyeshadow palettes. I love taupe-y shades. Meanwhile, Pat McGrathâs Mothership VII Divine Rose eyeshadow palette is great for going out.

The best lip liners ever are from Fara Homidi. Theyâre like nine million dollars, but I have never found better colors than Minky and Doux. I love all of the Bisou Balms from Violette_FR, too but especially Amour Fou and BÃªtise. Les Filles En Rouje has these great gold lip palettes. They make my lips look like I got them filled. I always toss the Signature one in my purse.
I just got the Chanel Multi-Use Glow Stick. Itâs really glistening and beautiful. Chanel also has my favorite waterproof eyeliner. Iâve been using 30 Marine, the navy blue one, since high school. Brown is also greatâI feel like black eyeliner looks really harsh on me since I have blue eyes. In the fall, I like LancÃ´meâs Black Coffee eyeliner, especially in my waterline.
HAIR
Jacob Schwartz at MÃ¨che Salon has been dyeing my hair for nine years. Iâve been blonde probably for seven years now. He does Margot Robbie, Sydney Sweeney, and any famous blonde really. Heâs the best. Thereâs something weird with comedy and blonde. For me, dark hair is drama, so when I did Francis Ford Coppolaâs movie Megalopolis, I had to be a brunette. Then I went back to SNL and everyone was confused. They were like, âYou have to be blonde.â This is dorky, but over the summer I went to ComÃ©die-FranÃ§aise, an old theater in Paris, and on the walls, one side was full of dramatic actors and the other side was comedic actors. All of the comedians were blonde or strawberry blonde, and all of the dramatic actors were brunette. Iâve at least figured out the color, but when it comes to the cut, Iâm like, âI donât know,â so I just get it short. My friend Desiree Roberts, who was the first person to make me blonde, cuts it. She cuts every one of my family and friendsâ hair, too. She even did my sisterâs hair at her wedding. If Iâm in New York and canât see Desiree or Jacob, I like Jenna Perry.
For products, I love RÅZ, Mara Roszakâs line. She does Emma Stone, and anything thatâs on her hair is great. It all smells like heaven. I use the Foundation shampoo and conditioner, but I love the Santa Lucia styling oil and the milk hair serum, too. LolaVie, Jennifer Anistonâs brand, smells so good, too, kind of like lemongrass and Malibu. And Kevin Murphyâs Doo Over is a really good hairspray. We use that at work.
FRAGRANCE
Iâve never liked feminine scents. I want my perfumes to be more gender-neutral. My girliest perfume is Maison Francis Kurkdjianâs Baccarat Rouge 540. Itâs really good, but now everyone wears it. Terre dâHermes is my tried-and-true. It smells orange-y and beautiful. I wore it all through college. My best friend, Casey Thomas Brown wears it. My boyfriend wears it. My dad wore it growing up, so I guess that makes me a disgusting pervert. [Laughs] I guess all the men in my life wear it.

Tom Broecker, who does the costumes at SNL, wears Straight to Heaven from Kilian. I would always ask what he was wearing, and heâd be like, âIâm not telling.â Finally, he told me, and I bought it. The same thing happened with a friend of mine who wore Escentric Molecule 01 and wouldnât tell me the name either. Then one day I was in an Uber Pool and I smelled it on someone who kindly told me what it was. And I wear AÄsop herbal deodorant, so that kind of acts like a scent, too.
At home, I burn Cire Trudonâs Abd El Kader candle. I love it, but Hotel Costes in Paris has my favorite candle. Itâs their brown scented candle. I have the room spray version, too.
FITNESS + NAILS
My parents got really into pilates in the â90s, so I had a full sex dungeon in my basement as a kid. I was in middle school when they got all the equipment, and thatâs when you have middle school parties and boys over, so all my memories are us destroying those machines and laughing. Then I learned pilates myself when I was 14, so I have 21 years of pilates under my belt. Not to brag. I am a broken person, and I need pilates to relax. If Iâm visiting my parents in Northern California, I go to XËCORE. If Iâm in LA, I go to Studio Metamorphosis. If Iâm in New York, I like SLT or Tracy Anderson.
I hate getting manicures and pedicuresâsitting there hurts my back. Itâs better if Iâm with my sister or my best friend because we just talk the whole time. For that I go to QQ Nails & Spa because theyâre fast and I can always walk in. Otherwise, if Iâm on my own, Iâd much rather get a massage. I do a 90-minute body massage and a 30-minute foot massage at All Seasons Body Work in Greenwich Village. Itâs the best.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:59,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/tina-chen-craig-u-beauty-routine/,"Tina Chen Craig, Founder, U Beauty",2351,"âI started Bag Snob, one of the worldâs first luxury fashion blogs, in 2005. Then I launched Beauty Snob. My passion has always really been in beauty because itâs such a great equalizer. Anyone can buy lipstick to make themselves feel better. And naturally, just blogging about beauty and working as an editor at Vogue China for five years, I then organically became a consultant for some of the biggest beauty brands in the world, including Natura BissÃ©, ClÃ© de Peau, La Prairie, Augustinus Bader, and Charlotte Tilbury.
Iâve since launched my brand, U Beauty. At the beginning, I really didnât think that the world needed another skincare brandâand certainly not from an influencer. But the opportunity came about when I was at dinner with my friend Skip Borghese, who Iâve known for almost 20 years, and his wife, Katie, who is now my co-founder. I was frustrated because I was traveling with a huge brand and no longer believed in the beauty industry. I felt like technology had not changed. It was stagnant. But they told me about these Siren capsules that they had been working on with a medical-grade lab in Italy that hadn't been brought to life. They asked if I wanted to create my dream product with them. I said, âWell, I donât believe what youâre telling me.â A delivery system thatâs intuitive and that would only benefit your skin where it needed it? It sounded like sci-fi.
Still, I ended up meeting with the Italians, as I call them, and gave them my ideas for a âlaser in a bottle.â At the time, I was in my mid-forties and I had the worst rosacea, so I couldn't use active ingredients. I was so scared to use retinol because, if you think about it, your face is not all the same. Some areas need the retinol and some areas donât. But weâre blindly applying it all over, hoping that it gets to where it needs to go, possibly irritating and definitely damaging healthy skin cells. We came up with the Resurfacing Compound, our first product. I took the sample to Paris Fashion Week, used it on a Tuesday, and three days later, at the Dior show on Friday, everybody was saying my skin looked amazing. This was at the end of fashion month, when everyoneâs tired, and there I was with glowing skin and no irritation. Thatâs when I realized the delivery system really worked.
Honestly, I used to hate serums. I thought they were such BS. But my friends, people like Joanna Czech, Eva Chen, and Michelle Lee, who are very knowledgeable about beauty, all tried it and loved it, too. Net-A-Porter ended up wanting to sell it because their head buyer tried it and her skin changed in three days. I thought to myself, âOK, weâll sell this much in a year and weâre never going to make another product. Itâs just enough for me to buy a bunch of Birkins and call it a day.â That year's supply sold out in 21 days. Thatâs how U Beauty came to be, the short version of it anyway.

SKINCARE
I started treatments like Botox very late, and honestly, I still donât get a lot of stuff done. In my twenties, I was busy working. I was trying to have a baby in my thirties, so I was not going to inject anything into my skin. By my forties, I decided to try. Now I get Botox from Dr. Daniel Belkin. He does microtox and PicoToning. He was the first person that I let use lasers on meâI do that twice a year now. Iâve tried microneedling, but I donât do it anymore because I felt like it was causing more pigmentation because of the inflammation. And Iâve done EmFace at Advanced Skin Fitness in Dallas.
When I was in Seoul last summer, I got a three-step tightening treatment from Blackpinkâs dermatologist. Sheâs this big secretâher name is Dr. Yoon. Thatâs all I can say because Iâve been sworn to secrecy. Sheâs all about improving the texture and health of the skin and avoiding surgery. She uses two electronic gloves that massage and tighten, and Korean acupuncture needles that are ten times thicker than Chinese acupuncture needles. She also invented a machine thatâs a hybrid of two othersâone of which is Ulthera. People usually get put under for it because itâs so painful but I stayed awake. It hurt like a mofo. I was so bruised after, tooâbut the tightening worked.
For facials I love Miranda Sturce, Joanna Czech, and IvÃ¡n Pol, or The Beauty Sandwich as people know him. IvÃ¡n is so knowledgeable. He has a machine that snatches you, and I love his SS01 Secret Sauce. Joanna is still my favorite though because no one slaps a face like her. Sheâs got the strongest hands in the world. Then, when it comes to tools, I love Jillian Dempseyâs gold bar and Nurse Jamieâs beauty roller, which is great for lymphatic drainage.
I used to have a triple cleanse routine and I always thought there had to be a better way. Our Mantle Skin Conditioning Wash is the answer. Itâs a beautiful, rich balm that really cleans and easily rinses off. Rather than using solubilizers to pull dirt and oil off your face, stripping your skin of its own natural oils, ours works with your skin to remove debris without stripping. Still, on days that I wear a lot of waterproof makeup for events, I use Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads. Theyâve been my best friends since I was in collegeâthey really wipe off everything.

My first step after cleansing is always the Resurfacing Compound. It has vitamin A, vitamin C, AHAs, PHAs, and antioxidants, so it replaces so many other serums while gently resurfacing without irritation. I follow it up with our Super Hydrator, which is like a 3D moisture shield that protects your skin. Itâs got a nice, rich cream texture. It melts into the skin and continually hydrates it for up to 48 hours.
Do you know about leaky vessels? I learned about them when I was going through a divorce and crying every night. My eye cream stopped working and I asked my biochemists why. They were like, âYou have leaky vessels,â and explained that as your skin ages, your blood vessels age, too, so when you cry, the extra cellular fluid gets pushed out through the vascular walls that are now more permeable. I was like, âMy husband left me and now I have leaky vessels? It went from bad to worse.â That was about two-and-a-half years ago, and not long after that we launched our Return Eye Concentrate. Iâm biased, but I think it is the best eye cream on the planet. Within two weeks of launching, it became one of the top eye creams at all our retailers. It has real diamond powder, and with our Siren capsules, itâs able to penetrate deeper into the skin and activate collagen synthesis.
For sunscreen, I use our Multimodal Defender Broad SPF 30. It not only protects the skin, but it also corrects past damage. Thereâs an ester in there that lightens and brightens pigmentation. I use it at night as a spot treatment, too. No one believes that I used to be a sun worshiperâa literal tanorexicâuntil I show them photos. Iâve spent the last 35 years trying to reverse the damage. For a good drugstore sunscreen, I love La Roche Posay.
MAKEUP
Iâve always been a glowy girl. Kevyn Aucoin used to say that five-year-olds glow in certain placesâlike, if you look at them, they always glow right above the lipâso I always start with our Super Tinted Hydrator in 02 or 03 depending on my mood, and Multimodal Defender SPF 30 as a makeup base because the zinc in it gives off such a great glow. I use Trish McEvoyâs Correct and Even Full-Face Perfector in shade 2 if I have an event, and then Shiseidoâs Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Concealer in 202 for my everyday life.
For my eyes, I love Victoria Beckhamâs waterline pencil. And Iâm obsessed with her satin kajal linersâall of them. Theyâre so creamy, and they donât pull out your lash extensions. But I also love Haus Labsâ Optic Intensity Eyeliner. Titanium Shimmer, the silver shade, brightens everything. All I do is buy eyeliners and lip liners; if you look in my makeup bag, I have 20 on me at all times.

Michelle Phan does such a great job with her brand, EmCosmeticsâI donât know why itâs not talked about more. I love the Divine Skies eyeshadow palette in Saturnâs Return. Huda Beautyâs creamy eyeshadow palettes are great, too. And for events, Westman Atelierâs Eye Pods are fabulous. I love Les Jours. Iâm also obsessed with Natasha Denona. I like that her Glam Eyeshadow Palette tells you where to use each shade so anyone can use it.
I use the Grande Lash Serum to grow my lashes. Iâve tried all the best ones, and this is the only one that actually works for me. If I donât have lash extensions because they all fell out, then Iâll use Charlotte Tilburyâs mascara. And I love the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Freeze Gel and Brow Definer in Taupe.
For blush, I use a cheek jelly from LB in Rose. You have to buy this at Don Quijote in Tokyo; itâs not available anywhere else. My sister-in-law lives in Tokyo, and she sends me six every year. When it comes to contour, I like the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Biscuit. I contour the bridge of my nose with it. If I donât want to put on eyeshadow, Iâll use it on my eyelids, too. Gucci Westman gave me that tip. Meanwhile, Iâve been using the Physicianâs Formula Butter Glow since high school. I also use Victoria Beckham Contour Stylus in Marble like a bronzer. I love the shade and how it looks on my skin.
My favorite lip liners are from Jones Road Beauty. I use Mauve all around to triple the size of my lips. Then I go in with Nudist, which is a little darker. Those are my most used. I love Charlotte Tilburyâs Lip Cheat in Supersize Me for events. Huda Beauty has a great lip contour, as well. Itâs self-sharpening. I love Muted Pink. And of course, our Plasma Lip Compound is amazing. My go-to is Orchid. Itâs great with the Jones Road Mauveâthatâs my daily combo. Then I set my face with Morphe Luminous Setting Spray.

HAIR
My hair is very high maintenance. Ever since I bleached my mop, I spend more on my hair than anythingâand Iâm very careful with it. My colorist stylist Adriana Tesler is in LA and has done my hair for 20 years. She was trained by Tracey Cunningham.
I only wash my hair once or twice a week. My favorite shampoo in the world is the R+Co Bleu Ingenious Thickening Shampooâand I live for their Bleu conditioner, too. I switch them off with the Color Wow Color Security Shampoo and conditioner to see to what that does. And I still love Olaplex. I donât care what anyone says. Every other week, I use their No.3 Hair Perfector as a hair mask and follow it up with the Olaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo and the No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner. In between washes, I spray my hair with the In Common Magic Myst 4-in-1 Leave-In. Then I put in Velcro curlersâmine are from a beauty store in Seoul called Olive Youngâand itâs like I got a fresh blowout. Thatâs my secret to keep it very minimal chemical damage. I donât even brush my hair. Owayâs Silkân Glow Serum is from Norway, but itâs hard to find in the US. Luckily, Adriana sells it at her salon. Itâs anti-frizz but also gives you a nice shine. I put a bit on my hands and then comb through my hair with them. I love the R+Co Bleu Smooth Seal Blow-Dry Mist, too. And Nick Stensonâs Light Hold Hair Spray is great.
I have my T3 straightening iron from 2007. Itâs literally 15 years old, and itâs blackâtheyâre all white now. Itâs still the best. My son and I fight over it. It heats up within three seconds, and I actually feel like it improves the health of my hair while I use it. Itâs sold out everywhere now. Iâm obsessed with the Dyson Airstrait, tooâand their Airwrap is pretty dope. And I love all of the T3 blow dryers.
FRAGRANCE
I go through two bottles of Matiere Premiere French Flower a year. Saks started selling it recently, but you could only get it in the UK before. I still like buying it in the Harrods fragrance hall, where I discovered it a few years ago. I also love Nasomattoâs Narcotic V. Overall, I love white florals that are kind of sexy and not too sweet, and thatâs exactly what it smells like.
When it comes to candles, Baies from Diptyque is a classic, but my favorite candle in the world is their limited edition London candle. They only release it every two years. Iâve been emailing the team, âWhere is it? Did you come out with it again? I need it.â It smells like walking through a garden on spring morning in London. Fresh and clean and beautiful.â

Soviet-Era Pseudoscience Lurks behind âHavana Syndromeâ Worries
Dodgy studies and fantastic claims have long powered a belief in devious Russian brain weapons, from mind control to microwave devices
By Keith Kloor
Personnel gathered at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba on September 29, 2017 in Havana, Cuba.

In the 1970s U.S. spy agencies believed that Soviet scientists were using telepathy and other supposed paranormal abilities to develop mind-control weaponry. U.S. Army and Air Force journals fretted about a ânew mental battlefieldâ of âpsychic warfare.â
If you saw The Men Who Stare at Goats, based on the nonfiction book by Jon Ronson, or read Annie Jacobsenâs Phenomena: The Secret History of the U.S. Governmentâs Investigations into Extrasensory Perception and Psychokinesis, then you know what happened next. The Defense Department for the next two decades squandered millions of dollars on ridiculous âpsychic spyâ research. It recruited paranormal enthusiasts to practice levitating and walking through walls, among other absurdities.
Most of us now chuckle at this screwball chapter of the cold war annals. But the roots of it, which can be traced to a wellspring of bogus Soviet-era studies fed to visiting American researchers and writers, is worth revisiting to better understand how the U.S. intelligence community got suckered into (and distracted by) a decades-long enchantment with the pseudoscience of parapsychology.

That history today offers us insight into the origin of Havana syndrome, the controversial medical condition best known for afflicting U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials. Many victims of these âanomalous health incidentsâ believe they suffer from brain injuries from a secret Russian acoustic or radiological microwave weapon. (Their symptoms include headaches, vertigo and fatigue.) Experts have pointed out why this is scientifically implausible. Moreover, federal investigators have found no trace of such a weapon. And a recent comprehensive National Institutes of Health study revealed no physical evidence of brain damage in self-identified victimsâmany who are former government personnel who worked in the State Department and CIA .
So why does the notion (especially in the news media) still persist that Russia is attacking people with some kind of portable directed energy device? Well, for starters, Russia has boasted of creating such a brain weapon, in various forms over many decades. In the 1990s, American cold warriors pivoted from worrying about Soviet psychic warfare to âpsycho-terrorism,â which they read about in Russian media. These new âpsychotronic weapons,â as the Russians dubbed them, were powered by x-rays, ultrasound and radio waves, and âused against the mind to induce hallucinations, sickness, mutations in human cells, âzombification,â or even death,â wrote military analyst Timothy L. Thomas in the U.S. Army War Collegeâs quarterly journal Parameters.
If American national security experts took Russia at its word, why shouldnât influential Havana syndrome proponents, who frequently cite dated Russian studies on health effects from exposure to microwave radiation?
This includes David Relman, a professor of medicine at Stanford, who in one 2021 NBC interview, points vaguely to this decades-old âRussian literatureâ as evidence for a âdeliberateâ use of âpulsed microwave energyâ in the Havana Syndrome incidents. Relman, notably, headed a controversial 2020 National Academy of Sciences report, which concluded that âdirected pulsed RF [radio frequency] energyâ was âthe most plausible mechanismâ for Havana syndrome symptoms.
Never mind that the NAS report provided no biological basis for this claim. But it did cite âsignificant research in Russia/USSRâ that examined military personnel exposed to pulsed microwave radiation. (Perhaps they were the test subjects for Putinâs âzombieâ ray gun.) These studies supposedly found that individuals suffered dizziness, depression, headaches and fatigue, among other ill effects (all which happen to match up with the symptoms reported by Havana syndrome victims). Oh, and by the way: the NAS report also acknowledges that âmany of the studies from the former Soviet Union were flawed in one or more ways.â
Somehow this dodgy Soviet-era science became the backbone for the microwave weapon theory. Its flimsy rationale defies both common sense and critical scrutiny. And yet, reputable journalism outlets contort themselves to make the argument. The latest example is an April 60 Minutes segment that suggested a dastardly Russian intelligence cell zapped U.S. officials all over the globe, including inside the White House. The 60 Minutes story, as skeptics noted, is fraught with illogical leaps and convenient omissions.
In response, adherents of the Russian microwave weapon theory have pointed to a long and detailed article published by The Insider, an investigative journalistic website that teamed up with 60 Minutes. But if you read the fine print, its story ultimately falls back onâyou guessed itâa âcorpus of scientific literatureâ from the Soviet Union, including a 1974 Soviet patent that claimed to successfully test a device that used radio waves to put people to sleep.
This reminded me of the infamous account of the Soviet psychic who could stop a frogâs heart with her mind, one of the many fantastical tales of Russian psychic prowess chronicled by American authors in the 1970s. There was a KGB-sponsored pipeline of this stuff that American readers ate up and that seemingly induced the U.S. intelligence community to fall down its paranormal rabbit hole.
As the intelligence historian Filip KovaÄeviÄ explained to me, psychic phenomena were at this time incompatible with Marxist (e.g., materialist) ideology in the U.S.S.R. But ESP (extrasensory perception) was all the rage in Americaâs Age of the Aquarius, and the Soviets took notice. âThat was something the Westerners wanted to hear (especially in the late 1960s and early 1970s) and the KGB supplied them with it,â he said to me in an e-mail. âMy sense is that most of what was known about Soviet science in the West during the [cold war] was a result of KGB disinformation.â
To suggest that the victims of Havana syndrome are just the latest in a long line of KGB dupes would be simplistic and insulting. I donât question their sincerity or the pain they have experienced, some still with debilitating injuries. At this juncture, the psychogenic theory strikes me as the most plausible explanation, particularly for those individuals working in a high stress environment, who might also have had earlier injuries. But we can also fault bad journalism, bad science and an inept bureaucracy for the growth of Havana syndrome as a sociocultural phenomenon.
It also seems possible that Havana syndrome is a byproduct of the recently heightened tensions between Russia and the United States that have been building since the 2014 seizure of Crimea that preceded the current war in Ukraine. Itâs worth remembering that the cold war in the 20th century between the two superpowers was rife with mutual paranoia and misinterpretations. In the 2010s, as tensions with China and Russia heightened, the concept of neurowarfare gained traction in military and intelligence circles. The concern here is that Americaâs foreign adversaries will develop nonlethal but incapacitating weapons that strike at the brain, via a chemical or biological agent or portable radiological device.
One of the leading Havana syndrome conceptualists is Georgetown University neuroscientist James Giordano, who is adamant that victims were attacked with a sonic or microwave weapon. He has argued this since 2018 and been an influential advisor on the issue to the U.S. government. Today, the idea of neurowarfare is regarded as a fait accompli by up-and-coming thinkers in the military. Havana syndromeâs emergence and the National Academy of Sciences reportâs conclusions have cinched it.
In the intelligence world, U.S. analysts are taught to be vigilant to cognitive biases that might confirm a preconception. Our adversaries have long sought to exploit such biases as a form of neurowarfare. In the end, that might be the real Havana syndrome.

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:18:54,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/quality-of-calories-more-important-than-quantity/,Is the Quality of Calories More Important Than Quantity?,738,"When youâre trying to lose weight, itâs almost impossible to bite into a rice cake without being offered diet advice: Cut carbs, limit fat, drink shakes, you name it. Is one approach better than another? Christopher Gardner, PhD, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, wanted to find out. You might be surprised to hear that the quality of your calories matters.
ResearchÂ published in JAMA compared the effectiveness of low-carb and low-fat diets for weight loss. Researchers followed 609 overweight adults for 12 months and discovered that, on average, dieters in both groups lost similar amounts of weight: Those following a low-fat diet lost 11.7 pounds while those following a low-carb diet lost 13.2 pounds.
âThere isnât one diet for everyone.â
Within the groups, there were significant differences in how participants fared on each diet: Some dieters lost as much as 60 pounds while others gained weight, leading Gardner to explain, âThere isnât one diet for everyone.â
Although prescribing a specific diet might not be effective for weight loss, the research revealed some important information.
Participants were not asked to consume a specific number of calories, but all were asked to lower their fat or carb intake (depending on their group), choose more whole foods, including vegetables, and minimize added sugars and refined grains. Those who followed that advice, focusing on the quality of the calories they consumed over the quantity, lost significant amounts of weight â regardless of whether their diets were low-carb or low-fat.
âSteel-cut oats and kale are both low-fat; so are sodas and white bread, but the oats and kale are likely more filling, more satiating. Avocados and nuts are both low-carb; so are lard and butter, but meals made with avocados and nuts may be more filling, more satiating,â Gardner explains.
Focusing on healthier, more satiating foods helped dieters feel full while eating less.
An earlier JAMAÂ studyÂ reported similar results. In 2012, 21 overweight adults were assigned to follow one of three diets: low-fat, low-carb or low-glycemic index for four weeks. Participants were instructed to replace grains and starches with vegetables, legumes, fruits and healthy fats. All dieters lost weight, but those who chose fewer carbs and ate more high-quality calories sped up their metabolisms, too, burning an additional 325 calories per day â about the same number of calories burned during an hour of moderate-intensity physical activity.
âThe quality of the foods we eat can have fundamental effects on hormones, metabolism and even the expression of genes throughout the body.â
âTheÂ typeÂ of calories we consume affects theÂ numberÂ of calories being burned. In other words, from a metabolic perspective, all calories areÂ notÂ alike to the body,â explains Dr.Â David S. Ludwig, co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Childrenâs Hospital. âThe quality of the foods we eat can have fundamental effects on hormones, metabolism and even the expression of genes throughout the body.â

Of course, the number of calories you consume still matters but Gardner believes itâs more important for people to choose foods that make them feel full and satisfied rather than obsessing over hitting a certain number of calories.
So, yes, [losing weight] involves eating fewer calories, but it isnât as simple as eat less (and not as depressing either),â he says. âWe would consider these quality components to be foundational to any kind of diet or eating pattern â¦ whether they are trying out low-fat, low-carb, paleo, vegan, Mediterranean [or another diet]. Itâs about finding the combinations of low-fat or low-carb meals and menus that you enjoyed and could enjoy for life that support weight goals.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:03,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/cyndi-ramirez-fulton-chillhouse-after-dark-beauty/,"Cyndi Ramirez-Fulton, Founder, Chillhouse",2150,"âChillhouse started off as a modern day spa concept in the Lower East Side, and over COVID, we launched a line of CPG productsâfrom press-on nails to body careâto help people find their chill. My husband, Adam, is my COO, but he is also a partner of Garrett Group, the hospitality group that owns and operates four bars in ManhattanâBandits, The Garrett West, Borrachito, and Roccoâs, and another Borrachito in Boston. Iâm not involved in the day-to-day of those businesses, but Iâm a small partner, so Iâm the First Lady, we like to say.
We live in Miami full-time now. We keep a little place in New York, but we made the decision to make Miami our home base over the summer. Itâs been great. We have two kidsâI just had a babyâand we did the parenting thing in Manhattan with Hendrix, our three year old, but having places to go outside became really important to us. We miss New York, but itâs calmer here. Weâve begun to love it, and weâre committed for the long haul.
If Iâm in New York, I like to start my nights out early. The first stop is always Banditâs because it used to be on the way home from the office. Our night out restaurant was Raoulâs. When weâre feeling a little naughty and weâre going to have that second or third martini that weâll regret the next day, we always end up there. Thatâs where we would probably end the night, but if weâre feeling frisky and want a nightcap, maybe weâd go to The Ear Inn on the way home. Lately, Iâve been on a spicy, skinny mezcal margarita kick, but I donât feel like thatâs always appropriate in New York settings. My husband is a big martini personâhe drinks vespersâand I like mezcal on the rocks.
In Miami, people definitely go out a lot later, which works out for us because we like to go out early to get home at a reasonable hour. There are a lot of clubs and a lot of entertainment. The places are all very grand, but theyâre not where I go at all. I wouldnât say that there are a lot of places where we as grown adults want to hang out for two drinks before heading to dinner. We live on the beach, so weâve been hanging out at hotel bars around here instead. Iâm a member of The Standard in Miami Beach. Their Monterrey Bar is a cute, classy spot.

Our dinner spot in Miami depends on our mood. South of Fifth tends to have the bigger, fancier grownup restaurants, but theyâre a splurge, so we donât always go in that direction. Otherwise, we love Mandolin in the Design District. We really love Branja, which is in a cute outdoor shopping mall called Upper Buena Vista. Macchialina is also in our rotation. Itâs a great Italian spot thatâs on the beach. If weâre having a nice date night, weâll go up to Surfside or Bal Harbor. Both areas have really nice restaurants. Makoto is one of our favorites.
I hate to say it because Iâm a New Yorker, but I think Pastis Miami is one of the best restaurants here. It was one of those spaces that Miami people, I think, really needed. It has all of the charm of the original. It almost has the exact layout of the original Pastis. The menu is slightly different than the one in New York, but I find it more exciting. Overall, I like the experience better. Iâve heard a lot of people say that too; itâs not just me.
SKINCARE
First things first, I always need to rinse off the day before going out for the night. I discovered the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Body Wash at a drugstore while I was traveling. Itâs since become a mainstay in my house. I like to do a quick scrub tooâI love our Under the Sea scrub. Depending on how Iâm feeling, Iâll either use the Osea Undaria Collagen Body Lotion or our Have A Chill Day Body Oil. The lotion is a bit thicker, and I donât always want something heavy on my skin. Our body oil also comes in a spray bottle, which really allows for the oil to spread out. Itâs just light overall, down to the scent, which is a little citrus-y.
I keep a couple of face washes in the shower. Right now Iâm obsessed with the U Beauty Skin Conditioning Wash. Itâs a little more moisturizing than your typical face cleanser, and it requires a very light rinse. To take off my makeup at the end of the night, I keep the Dermalogica PreCleanse Balm, along with the Dermalogica Microfoliant, on my sink.

Once Iâm out of the shower, I use our Steam Room body mist as my toner. Iâm always mixing it up when it comes to serums, but right now, Iâm leaving the CaudalÃ­e Vinoperfect Radiance Serum. I like that it feels creamy, and Iâve definitely noticed my skin is brighter since I started using it.
I love a face tool, and I think our Chill Globes are great at night for tightening and snatching your face. Theyâre made out of stainless steel. We used to have glass ones, but people would maybe leave them in the fridge for too long and a couple of people said that they broke. Glass just wasnât ideal.
Since itâs late at night, I donât need to wear SPF, so I just go for the La Mer Moisturizing Soft Cream and Eye Concentrate instead. I also love the Meaningful Beauty neck and dÃ©colletÃ© cream. Itâs from Cindy Crawfordâs skincare line, which uses melon antioxidants. All of the products Iâve tried from the brand are really lovely and light on the skinânothing ever feels like itâs weighing me downâbut I think the neck treatment is the best. I see an immediate difference with itâmy skin looks tighter and my wrinkles are a little bit more diminished.
MAKEUP
In Miamiâversus New YorkâI definitely like for my makeup to be a little peachier. I also wouldnât add as much bronzer in New York.
I start with the One/Size Secure the Blur primer. I have so many One/Size products now. Itâs a great line, especially for going out. The Fenty Beauty Pro Filtâr is my favorite foundationâI use shade 290âbut Iâve been mixing foundations recently. I just got the Westman Atelier Vital Skin Foundation Stick in Atelier X which I layer on top of the Fenty Beauty if I want slightly heavier coverage. I like to use the Merit Clean Foundation & Concealer Stick in Khaki under my eyes to cover any hyperpigmentation, in the corners of my nose, and around my lips.
I love the One/Size Cheek Clapper Palette in Rich Betch to bronze. Itâs a trio of colors, two powders and one cream. I use a mix of the powders. I like to layer the Rose Inc Cheek & Lip Color in Daylily because itâs very soft and I want it to look like I have different dimensions happening on my face. But then I like a little pop of pink or peach on my cheeks, and for that, my go-to is NARS Blush in Orgasm. Itâs the OG, especially for a night out because it has a little shimmer. Itâs absolutely perfect.
After my blush, I start to set my makeup with the Rare Beauty setting powder. Itâs super light. Iâve been using it in the same way that people use their powders to contour a little bit.

I love Saniaâs Brow Bar pencil in Medium. I went to the studio once, and Sania Vucetaj, the founder, had some great tips. I used to wax my brows and have since had a hard time growing them back. Sania said that the reason theyâre not growing is because we put so much skincare over our brows, so weâre not letting the hair follicles breathe. The other thing that changed the game for meâand Iâve actually been seeing a differenceâis not using brow gels. My brow hairs are a little wonky, but she insists we should just brush them.
The Necessary Eyeshadow Palette in Warm Nude from Ilia is great. The colors are really nice for the daytime, but it has a couple of shimmers that you can layer on at night. I love Lineup, the dark brown shade, as my base. Makeup by Marioâs Master Crystal Reflector in Quartz is a highlighter, but I like to use it mostly on my eyes. Itâs super pretty. To actually highlight, I use Fenty Beautyâs Diamond Bomb in How Many Carats?!
The One/Size Point Made eyeliner pen in Bodacious Black is by far the best eyelinerâbelieve me, Iâve tried them all. One/Sizeâs glides really well, and it hasnât dried out on me, which I feel like a lot do. But Iâve had a hard time with mascaras recently. For some reason, my eyelashes are all over the place and none of the mascaras that Iâve been wearing lately have been able to tame them. I tried Westman Atelierâs Eye Want You mascara, and it was really nice but also very light. Itâs not a nighttime option for me. For an evening where you want your eyelashes to really pop, Iâd go with LancÃ´meâs Monsieur Big mascara. You have to be patient with it and do a lot of layers, but it does the trick. Honestly, Iâve been looking into false eyelashes because I've been so frustrated with the mascara process.
Lately, Iâve been using Pat McGrathâs PermaGel lip pencil in Divine Rose. I love a rosy lipâthatâs my everyday. That pencil is super soft and doesnât cake. Violette_FRâs Bisou Balm in BÃªtise is so beautiful. Itâs a good layerable lipstick. I top it off with Tower 28âs Lip Jelly in Pistachio. Itâs my favorite gloss. Ami ColÃ©âs Lip Treatment Oil in Smitten, a bright pink, is good, too.
To set everything, I use One/Sizeâs On 'Til Dawn setting spray. It looks like an aerosol can, and it's very satisfying to spray it on your face.
HAIR
I am terrible with my hair. Iâve tried to get better over time, but Iâm just so lazy with it. Especially when Iâm going out at night, itâs too long of a process to take a shower, wash my hair, and get ready. I generally just take a hot tool to my dirty hair and curl a few piecesâthe Drybar Tress Press straightening iron is good for both curling or flattening. Thatâs usually the extent of it. If anything, maybe Iâll add a little Crown Affair hair oil to give it some shine and some OUAI Texturizing hair spray for a quick fix of sorts.

NAILS
Our Chillhouse Tipsy Tinsel press-on nails are perfect for the day and going out. The base is pearly, but then they have a chrome wave across for the perfect little bit of sparkle. Theyâre my go-to for the nighttime. We launched our press-ons in mid-2020, which was very early in the press-on wave. Itâs getting crazier and more crowded for sure. This year, weâll be heavily diversifying our Chill Tips assortment, adding different lengths, shapes, textures, colors, and designs. I donât ever want to just give you a red nail; everything has to have that Chillhouse twist.
FRAGRANCE
While Iâm getting ready, I like to burn our Meet Me in the Lobby candle. Itâs literally designed to smell like a sexy hotel lobby so itâs perfect for getting ready at night because it gets you in the mood. It has white amber, musk, and oud.
Diptyque has a lot of scents that I love, but I went to their store recently to buy a home fragrance and walked out with LâEau Papier. The girl at the register said to me, âThis is the best scent ever. Donât tell anyone, but itâs amazing.â I spritzed myself and fell in love. Itâs so intoxicating, maybe because it has white musk and blond wood accords. It reminds me of another perfume that I bought in France, but I feel like I could actually wear this one during the day, too because itâs not as rich and heavy.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:52,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/gabriella-khalil-palm-heights-beauty-routine/,"Gabriella Khalil, Creative Director, Palm Heights",1749,"âI founded Palm Heights in Grand Cayman in 2019, and Iâm now the Creative Director. I do a little bit of everything, from curating the guest experience to organizing the event programming. When Iâm in Cayman, my nights out are almost always at Palm Heights. Sometimes I might have some friends in town, but typically, Iâm hosting events for our guests. I hosted a beautiful dinner on the beach to celebrate International Womenâs Day with an amazing group of 20 women earlier this month. We also throw our âIconic Ballâ every year to launch the season. Last year, I produced the whole event on our rooftop. We had Mya perform, which was pretty iconic. I wore Christopher John Rogers and danced all night. And every Saturday, Paradise Pizza, our little pizza spot, throws an event called the Mambo Italiano that turns into a huge karaoke party. Itâs hot out, but everyone gets really dressed up and goes crazy.
I moved to New York from London a year and a half ago, so Iâm still discovering the city. Nights out here mean going to really nice dinners with my friends. I love going to The Grill. I worked on Habibi, so Iâve had a lot of nights out there. Frenchette is good, too. They have the best natural wine. New York is cool because itâs spontaneous. Someone will be like, âLetâs pop over there.â Itâs so fun.
SKINCARE
My look tends to be the same, whether Iâm heading to a work event or to a great dinner or to a party with my friends. I want to look natural but glowy, and bronzy with full lips. If I have time, I like to start off with a 111Skin rose gold mask and the Sephora Collection roller. Sometimes Iâll only use 111Skinâs eye patches. Both the face masks and eye patches give your skin a nice lift.
Lesseâs Regeneration Mist is so refreshing. I like to spray it on my face and body. But I use Epi.Logicâs Even Balance Toner a lot, especially after a long night. Iâm obsessed with Biologique Rechercheâs Serum Extraits Tissulaires, too. I really see a difference when I donât use it. My skin feels drier and just off. I recently started using In Fioreâs VeloutÃ©e Complexe. Itâs this really light eye and lip serum. Makeup goes on so smoothly after I use it, but itâs also great before going to sleep. Then, if I want a lighter moisturizer, I grab Dermalogicaâs Active Moist. But if I need something a little heavier, I like Lesseâs Essential Moisturizer.
Soft Serviceâs Buffing Bar is amazing. I use it if I want to feel really fresh. Out of the shower, I love NÃ©cessaireâs body lotion. Itâs easy and really hydrating. I usually use the unscented one, but I like the eucalyptus one, too. I also use NÃ©cessaireâs deodorant. I go back and forth between that one and Salt & Stoneâs black rose and oud deodorant. I was really shy about using natural deodorants for a long time. I felt like they werenât going to work so I didnât want to chance it, but I even use them in Cayman now. And I have to say that the Soft Services Theraplush hand cream is so goodâI use it every night.

MAKEUP
Iâve used Bobbi Brownâs Full Cover Concealer in Natural Tan for years. True to its name, it gives you great coverage, but itâs also not cakey. Itâs great under my eyes. If I want a proper foundation, I use Youngbloodâs Liquid Mineral Foundation in Golden Tan (Neutral). Someone recommended it when I lived in London. Iâve always had breakouts, and this helps cover them. But Iâm trying not to go so heavy with product, so Iâm testing Cieleâs tint now. Itâs been good so far. Itâs great because it has SPF in it. I use 05 Medium.
I only contour if Iâm going out, never during the day. I like Bobbi Brownâs Skin Cream Foundation Stick. I use Cool Golden C076 on my forehead, cheeks, a little bit on my nose, and under my chin. I go very, very light-handed with it. I love makeup thatâs easy, and this stick is definitely easy. I blend it out with Sephora Collectionâs #78 brush. Then I use the NARS Laguna Bronzing Powder with Sephora Collectionâs #50 powder brush. Iâve used Laguna for such a long timeâI was devastated recently because I dropped one in Cayman, and it shattered into a million pieces. I set it with Charlotte Tilburyâs setting powderâI use 2 Medium. Itâs a nice powder to keep in your purse. And then Iâve been trying Cieleâs blush in the shade Kirsty, a warm nude. I use one tiny dot, and it looks really natural. It has SPF, too.

Iâve also used the Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick in Bronze for years and years. I love to put it on my nose, and I donât know why but I also highlight my chin a bit. Sometimes I like to use it as eyeshadow during the day. It plays with the light well and gives you this really beautiful sparkle. I got the Chanel Transparent Baume Essentiel as a gift, and I like it on my cheekbones, especially when Iâm at Palm Heights and want more of that just-spent-time-on-the-beach glow. I wasnât expecting to like it honestly, but itâs so soft. I brought the Saie Glow Super GelâI have the Starglow shadeâdown to Cayman with me recently, and it was really nice. You can put it all over, even on your collarbones, and it makes you look so healthy.
Makeup by Marioâs Original Master Mattes palette is my new favorite eyeshadow, and I have a ton of palettes, so thatâs saying a lot. It has every color you need. I have three of them, one in my work bag, one at Palm Heights, and one at my apartment. And Iâm a big eyebrow person, but I hate overdoing them. Glossierâs Boy Brow really works for me because itâs simple and deposits just the right amount of color. I brush it through with a spoolie. Benefitâs They're Real! mascara is my favorite. Thereâs literally none left in the tube right now. I have thick lashes, and some volumizing mascaras make my lashes really clumpy but this one doesnât. I buy it over and over.
For my lips, Iâm a straight Charlotte Tilbury girl. I love the Lip Cheat liner in Foxy Brown and the Lip Lustre Gloss in Seduction. I have her lipstick in Very Victoria, too. Someone told me itâs named after Victoria Beckham. I go between this one and the Kim K.W. shade. Iâm obsessed with that color. A makeup artist introduced me to it. Iâll do all threeâliner, lipstick, and glossâif I really want to go for it, but sometimes I skip the lipstick and only do liner and gloss. It depends on my mood. Oh, and as Iâm getting ready, nothing works as good as Vaseline to prep your lips. You canât beat it.
Even though itâs hot in Cayman, my makeup holds up without setting spray. Thatâs good, because I hate how setting spray feels. Iâm more concerned with taking off excess oil. I carry Clean & Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets with me. Old school.

HAIR
My hair is naturally wavy and big, but I like to wear it dead straight most of the time. I use the Drybar straightening iron. I have a Dyson hair dryer, too, but I have a lot of hair and it takes a long time to dry it, so I like to prolong my straightened hair as long as I can. I think using good products helps. I just started using Anablue. They have a hair serum and a treatment oil, but their scalp cleanser is fantastic. I use it once a week in place of shampoo. Iâm obsessed with washing my hairâI really like the feeling of itâand the cleanser is a good addition. It smells great. And I love David Mallettâs serum #DM027âHannan Siddique cuts my hair at Davidâs salon in New York. It makes your hair so shiny. Charlotte Mensah also makes a great Manketti hair oil. I use it right out of the shower. And LâOrealâs Elnett satin hairspray is an OG. Itâs the best.
NAILS
Iâm very simple and kind of boring when it comes to my nails. Sometimes Iâll switch it up, but I tend to go for neutral colors like Essieâs Ballet Slippers. I used to go for darker shades like dark brown or deep purple and I would get gel manicures, but when I had my daughterâsheâs six nowâI didnât want to deal with the upkeep anymore. I feel like it doesnât matter if my polish chips when I have a neutral shade because itâs less noticeable. That said, if I want to get a gel manicure now for a special occasion, I go to Naomi Yasuda. Sheâs incredible. Otherwise, Iâll pop in wherever for regular polish.
FRAGRANCE
Costa Brazilâs Aroma is my favorite perfume. Itâs woody and smoky. It has amber, which I love, even in candles. Itâs also refillableâIâm actually all out of my current bottleâand the container is so unique. I was devastated when the brand was rumored to be closing. I go back and forth between that one and L'Artisan Parfumeurâs Bois Des Sables. Itâs this amazing rose and pepper scent that I found in Paris. I love unexpected combinations like this.
In an ideal world, Iâm lighting a candle to set the mood for the nightâbut I usually donât. I like Byredo Fleur FantÃ´me a lot, and of course, I have our Palm Heights candle, which has amber, too. Costa Brazilâs Jungle is the best candle ever. Itâs so luxurious, vegan, and smells like the heart of the Amazon.â

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:19:04,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/nutrition-scientist-on-apple-cider-vinegar-for-weight-loss/,Nutribollocks: Whatâs the Deal With Apple Cider Vinegar and Weight Loss?,866,"Amanda Oliver has more than a decade of experience in commerce and media, specifically in product testing and service journalism in the lifestyle, health and wellness, and outdoor space.Â Amanda is currently the Executive Editor of Commerce at Field & Stream. She is also an RYT-200 yoga teacher and NASM CPT personal trainer.
Stephanie Nelson (MS, RD) is a Registered Dietitian and is MyFitnessPalâs in-house nutrition expert and nutrition scientist. Passionate for promoting healthy lifestyles, Stephanie graduated from San Diego State University with a focus on research and disease prevention.
If youâre feeling overwhelmed by the conflicting nutritional advice out there, youâre not alone. In this Nutribollocks series, our registered dietitians and scientific advisory board members take a hard look at scientific studies and claims, separating fact from fiction so you donât have to.
Over the last few years, apple cider vinegar has blossomed into a trendy weight loss supplement, with plenty of celebrities and health and wellness influencers touting its fat-burning benefits. From daily ACV shots to vinegar-filled gummies, the pantry staple became a much-talked-about topic.
And now, there may be science behind the ACV obsession. A recent study published in the BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health journal claims that daily consumption of apple cider vinegar could be linked to significant weight loss.
Because weâre dedicated to ensuring the nutrition information we share is backed by credible science, we did a little investigating. We asked Dr. Nicola Guess, nutrition scientist and member of the MyFitnessPal Scientific Advisory Board, to dig into the research and tell us: is this fact? Or is it nutribollocks?
The verdict: Likely Nutribollocks.
Think something as simple as drinking apple cider vinegar to achieve your weight loss goals sounds too good to be true? Well, you might be right. Dr. Guess describes this specific study as unreliable, pointing out a few major flaws.
âThe degree of weight loss is extremely unusual,â she says, comparing it to other trials. âEven in trials where they do see an impact of ACV on weight, itâs typically a difference of 1.0-1.5k g compared to the close to 7 kg weight loss they see here.â This means people were losing about a pound per week with the ACV and no reported caloric deficit, which Dr. Guess notes isnât in line with any research sheâs seen.
Hereâs another thing to think about. Sometimes when a research study shows really surprising results like this one, we need to consider if the design of the study and the data collected are reliable enough to make strong conclusions. After looking at the study, Dr. Guess didnât think it was good enough to prove that ACV could actually significantly help with weight loss as suggested.
Thatâs not to say that apple cider vinegar has zero effect on weight lossâjust that more research needs to be done for any conclusive evidence. âThere are other studies that show a minor benefit to consuming ACV, but there arenât many studies in humans demonstrating this,â Dr. Guess explains. âBecause consuming ACV in small doses (1-2 tbsp/day) is low-risk, we donât recommend against it, but donât depend on it for weight loss.â
Apple cider vinegar may not be the cure-all that the study claims it to be. Fortunately, there are other drinks that might help speed up your weight loss, according to MFP lead scientist Stephanie Nelson. The key is to stop drinking your calories. Caloric beverages are typically high in sugar but they donât fill you up the way food would..
âIâd recommend beverages that are easy swaps for sugary drinks. This includes flavored sparkling waters or diet soda for regular soda and coffee with sugar-free flavored creamer instead of flavored lattes,â MFP lead scientist Stephanie Nelson says.
However, at the end of the day, weight loss is less about what you drink or what trendy supplements you take and more about what you eat. âItâs still most effective to lose weight through tracking and eating a high-quality diet,â Dr. Guess explains.
You can do both of those things through the MyFitnessPal appâwhich is a great place to start if your goal is sustainable weight loss. No shots of vinegar necessary.

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:19:13,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/what-are-healthiest-coffee-creamers/,What Are the Healthiest Coffee Creamers?,945,"If youâre among the millions of Americans who enjoy a creamy texture and hint of flavor in your morning brew, youâre probably constantly looking for the best healthy coffee creamers. But since many options come with high sugar content, enjoying your morning routine without unnecessary calories affecting your health goals can be challenging.
The good news? There are plenty of healthy creamer options to choose from. Today, weâre providing our top picks for the best alternatives to replace traditional coffee creamers and preserve the sanctity of your daily coffee ritual.
For a true enthusiast, the best coffee creamer isnât just low in fat and sugar; it also has high-quality ingredients and natural flavors that make no concessions on taste.
Although there are many healthy options available, weâve scoured the shelves and consulted with registered dietitian Katherine Basbaum compile a list of the healthiest coffee creamers in three categories: healthiest powdered coffee creamers, dairy creamers, and plant-based creamers.
As far as powdered, non-dairy coffee creamers go, they donât get much healthier than the Think Creamer from Four Sigmatic. With only 15 calories per serving and no added sugars, consider switching to this healthiest coffee creamer for weight loss. You wonât believe how rich and flavorful your coffee gets with less than a teaspoon!
This unique coffee creamer even has added benefits. The creamy powder is infused with organic lionâs mane, which can positively affect your mental focus, such as enhancing memory function. This organic option also uses tea extract (L-Theanine), and according to Basbaum, âL-Theanine can offer sustained energy and promote mental health.â
Nutritional content per suggested serving (1 tbsp):
Prymal Creamer, cinnamon dolce
Imagine a morning latte thatâs just as delicious as your favorite big brand cinnamon dulce but with zero grams of sugar instead of 20? Thatâs what you get with Prymal. With a wide selection including Salted Caramel, French Vanilla, and Butter Pecan, all of Prymalâs powdered coffee creamers are completely sugar-free with no artificial flavors.
Our pick, Cinnamon Dolce, uses only natural, plant-based ingredients such as monk fruit and stevia for an authentic cinnamon and brown sugar taste. The natural coffee creamer also includes coconut oil, erythritol, and chicory root extract. Basbaum says, âSince thereâs no added glucose, itâs a great option for those on keto diets or anyone who wants to reap the benefits of cutting back on sugar.â
Nutritional content per suggested serving (4 tsp):
ChobaniÂ® dairy coffee creamer, sweet cream
For anyone who wants a low-fat creamer made from real dairy products, the ChobaniÂ® line line is perfect for you.
Using only four ingredients â real milk, natural cream, cane sugar, and natural flavors â these creamers contain no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, emulsifiers, or carrageenans. With nine varieties, ChobaniÂ® creamers are ideal for coffee enthusiasts who donât mind a dash of extra sweetness in their morning brew.
Nutritional content per suggested serving (1 tbsp):
So Delicious dairy-free organic coconut creamer, french vanilla
When it comes to milk alternatives, this organic coconut creamer with 30 calories per serving and only 1 gram of fat stands out.
Vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free, this healthy creamer for coffee from So Delicious uses organic ingredients for a rich, creamy texture with just the right amount of natural sweetness. With no added oils and non-GMO project certification, French Vanilla is one of the healthiest plant-based coffee creamers you can buy.
Nutritional content per suggested serving (1 tbsp):
Elmhurst almond milk, Barista Edition
Thereâs a reason this almond milk from Elmhurst is called the Barista Edition â the quality is that good. Dairy-free with no oils, gums, fillers, emulsifiers, or preservatives, this special edition almond milk uses the patented HydroReleaseâ¢ method to preserve nutritional density and integrity.
The result? A silky smooth milk ideal for steaming and foaming. Basbaum adds, âWith the benefits of switching to plant-based milk beginning to pile up, this Kosher, gluten-free option is ideal if you take your coffee without sugar.â
Nutritional content per suggested serving (240 ml):
Is Natural BlissÂ® creamer healthy?
Yes! Although it didnât make our list, Nestleâs Natural BlissÂ® coffee creamerÂ  is another healthy option. Made with natural cream and no artificial flavors, it contains only 35 calories per serving and is a great choice for your morning coffee.
What are some coffee creamers without oil?
Many healthy coffee creamers have no added oils or gums. Three of the brands on our list â Elmhurst, So Delicious, and ChobaniÂ® â fall into that category. Two other options include nutpodsâ dairy-free creamer and this pistachio crÃ¨me oat creamer from Elmhurst.
Is almond creamer healthy?
It can be, but not every brand is. Some almond creamer brands contain additives such as high fructose corn syrup, affecting overall health. So remember to read the ingredient list and check for added sweeteners before switching brands.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:06,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/gabriela-berlingeri-diciembre-veintinueve-beauty-routine/,"Gabriela Berlingeri, Founder, Diciembre Veintinueve",1456,"âIâve always wanted to have my own brand, but I thought I would start with swimsuits since I grew up in Puerto Rico and so much of my life is spent on the beach. But then I started working with a local jewelry company and learned how to create my own designs. Iâm inspired by the ocean, the sand, and the seashells, and there were certain pieces that I wanted for myself that I didnât see anywhere. Thatâs how Diciembre Veintinueve started. Weâve become known for our sun necklaceâI have a little obsession with sunsets. Iâve actually seen a lot of people wearing it during nights out.
Going out in Puerto Rico is intense because itâs so hot. You really have to plan out what youâre going to do with your hair and what youâre going to wear so youâre comfortable. A night out for me usually means going to a bar; Iâm not into fancy places. In San Juan we have La Placita de Santurce, but itâs a little bit too touristy, so I try to get away from it. Thereâs Calle LoÃ­za and Calle Cerra, which are streets with a lot of bars that are all within walking distance. Thereâs where more of the locals goâbut you have to speak Spanish or the bartenders will know youâre not from here. I love this little bar called La Chilleria. They put on very good musicâif you want to ask for a song, theyâll play it, tooâbut you canât go with too many people because itâs very small. Oh, and they have hookah. It can get a little wild there, so if I want more of a chill night, Iâll go to La Disquera. They have a lot of vinyls. On Calle LoÃ­za, thereâs a place called Roofyard. Itâs on a rooftop and they have great drinks.
SKINCARE
Every skincare product I use was recommended by my dermatologist. I donât always know what itâs doing honestly, but if she tells me to do it, I do it. So when Iâm getting ready to put on makeup, I always grab the same three products: Alastin Restorative Skin Complex, Alastin Ultra Light Moisturizer, and SkinCeuticals Phyto A+ Brightening Treatment Lightweight Moisturizer. Hydration is always the goal. The same goes for my body because Iâm always in the sun and it can get a bit dry. The Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture Lotion is so good. It leaves my skin very glowy and makes it look very rich. For an extra glow, I like to layer Baja Zenâs Coco Glow Body Glow Oily. Someone gave it to me for my birthday recently. It smells amazing, kind of like coconut and pineapple. You smell like a walking piÃ±a colada, in a good way. [Laughs]

MAKEUP
Primer is essential in Puerto Rico. Milk Makeupâs Hydro Grip Gripping Primer is greatâyour makeup doesnât budge at all. If I forget to apply it, Iâll wash my face and start over. I donât care if Iâm late.
I like to mix Drunk Elephantâd D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops with the Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech FoundationâI use shade 200 Light Medium Neutralâespecially if Iâm a little tan. The foundation feels so light on your skin and you donât need a lot of it, so it never feels cakey. I have zero complaints. For bronzer, I like to use the Makeup by Mario Soft Sculpt Shaping Stick in Medium. I like to wear it on my forehead and sometimes on my neck. Honestly, I donât know if Iâm using it correctly, but if it looks good, I guess it works. [Laughs]
I use blush to make it look like I got a sunburn, so I put it on my cheeks, under my eyes and on my forehead. Those are the areas that get color when I go to the beach, and Iâm always trying to recreate the look. Like, I want to look like I left the beach, took a bath, and then just walked out. Patrick Taâs Major Headlines CrÃ¨me & Powder Blush Duo in Sheâs Blushing is my go-to. I actually like to blend it with my concealer. Most of the time, I only use concealer to cover up spots, but I might wear more if Iâm going to a club and itâll be a long night. I went on a journey trying to find the best one, and I landed on Makeup by Marioâs SurrealSkin Awakening Concealer. Itâs so creamy and doesnât crease. I use shade 200 Light Medium Neutral. Then I set it with the powder from Patrick Taâs Major Sculpt CrÃ¨me Contour & Powder Bronzer Duo. I usually have Sheâs Sculpted around. After that, I like Charlotte Tilburyâs Airbrush Flawless Finish Setting Powder in shade 1 Fair for my T-zone and around my mouth.

Too Facedâs Better Than Chocolate Eye Shadow Palette has a lot of bronzy colors. I use the matte shades with a brush, and if I want to add any of the sparkly ones, I use my finger because I get more product that way. I like to use shadow as eyeliner, too. I find that it usually works better and stays on longer than actual eyeliner. I do like Huda Beautyâs Life Liner if I want to make my eyes pop more though.
I love Wonderskinâs Lip Tint in the shade Lovely. Itâs blue, but when you take it off, you have the most perfect, natural stain. I bought three of the same colorâitâs that good. You donât have to wear lipstick after, but I like to top it off with the Make Up For Everâs Brow, Eye & Lip Liner in the shade Anywhere Caffeine. Itâs actually the same color as my lips. I like to outline them and then fill in the middle, and they look so plump. Then I add the Dior Lip Glow Oil in 20 Mahogany on top. If I donât have that one around, Iâll grab the Clarins Lip Comfort Oil Shimmer in Honey.
I donât pluck or touch my eyebrows at all since I had them microbladed two years ago, so honestly, I usually forget to do my brows when Iâm going out. But if I do use something, itâs the Makeup Revolution Soap Styler Stick to brush them up a bit.
Yves Saint Laurentâs Lash Clash in Uninhibited Brown is my go-to mascara. The brown makes my eyes pop, and the brush really extends your lashes and makes them look very long. Itâs not waterproof, but Iâve worn it to the beach and it didnât run.
And then the One/Size On âTil Dawn Setting Spray is like concrete on your face. That sounds harsh, but itâs amazing. Nothing is coming off. Iâve gone out and come back to my house looking the same.

FRAGRANCE
Recently, Iâve been going back and forth between two perfumes. Jo Maloneâs Scarlet Poppy is so soft and cozy. If I want something stronger, Iâll go with Carolina Herreraâs Good Girl Blush. Itâs also a warm floral, but itâs mixed with vanilla. Itâs really long-lasting.
NAILS
Iâm very basic when it comes to my clothing, so when it comes to my nails, I go all out. Keishla Marie at Intus Nails & Hair Studio does them perfectly. I used to get square tips, but Iâve been doing almond recently. I get tired of the same design, so I tend to change them pretty often. For my 30th birthday in late December, I got a French manicure with lots of colored crystals.
HAIR
With the humidity in Puerto Rico, my hair can get really big. I try to work with that, so I make little waves for a lived-in messy look with the Conair Infiniti PRO 1-inch to Â½-inch Curling Wandâironing it would just never work. I dry it first with the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer. Color Wowâs Dream Coat Supernatural Spray is a big help too, but if you run into me during a night out, youâll see me constantly touching my hair and trying to fix it. [Laughs] The humidity is no joke.â

AI Report Shows âStartlingly Rapidâ ProgressâAnd Ballooning Costs
A new report finds that AI matches or outperforms people at tasks such as competitive math and reading comprehension
By Nicola Jones & Nature magazine

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, such as the chatbot ChatGPT, have become so advanced that they now very nearly match or exceed human performance in tasks including reading comprehension, image classification and competition-level mathematics, according to a new report. Rapid progress in the development of these systems also means that many common benchmarks and tests for assessing them are quickly becoming obsolete.
These are just a few of the top-line findings from the Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2024, which was published on 15 April by the Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University in California. The report charts the meteoric progress in machine-learning systems over the past decade.
In particular, the report says, new ways of assessing AI â for example, evaluating their performance on complex tasks, such as abstraction and reasoning â are more and more necessary. âA decade ago, benchmarks would serve the community for 5â10 yearsâ whereas now they often become irrelevant in just a few years, says Nestor Maslej, a social scientist at Stanford and editor-in-chief of the AI Index. âThe pace of gain has been startlingly rapid.â

Stanfordâs annual AI Index, first published in 2017, is compiled by a group of academic and industry specialists to assess the fieldâs technical capabilities, costs, ethics and more â with an eye towards informing researchers, policymakers and the public. This yearâs report, which is more than 400 pages long and was copy-edited and tightened with the aid of AI tools, notes that AI-related regulation in the United States is sharply rising. But the lack of standardized assessments for responsible use of AI makes it difficult to compare systems in terms of the risks that they pose.
The rising use of AI in science is also highlighted in this yearâs edition: for the first time, it dedicates an entire chapter to science applications, highlighting projects including Graph Networks for Materials Exploration (GNoME), a project from Google DeepMind that aims to help chemists discover materials, and GraphCast, another DeepMind tool, which does rapid weather forecasting.
The current AI boom â built on neural networks and machine-learning algorithms â dates back to the early 2010s. The field has since rapidly expanded. For example, the number of AI coding projects on GitHub, a common platform for sharing code, increased from about 800 in 2011 to 1.8 million last year. And journal publications about AI roughly tripled over this period, the report says.
Much of the cutting-edge work on AI is being done in industry: that sector produced 51 notable machine-learning systems last year, whereas academic researchers contributed 15. âAcademic work is shifting to analysing the models coming out of companies â doing a deeper dive into their weaknesses,â says Raymond Mooney, director of the AI Lab at the University of Texas at Austin, who wasnât involved in the report.
That includes developing tougher tests to assess the visual, mathematical and even moral-reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which power chatbots. One of the latest tests is the Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark (GPQA), developed last year by a team including machine-learning researcher David Rein at New York University.
The GPQA, consisting of more than 400 multiple-choice questions, is tough: PhD-level scholars could correctly answer questions in their field 65% of the time. The same scholars, when attempting to answer questions outside their field, scored only 34%, despite having access to the Internet during the test (randomly selecting answers would yield a score of 25%). As of last year, AI systems scored about 30â40%. This year, Rein says, Claude 3 â the latest chatbot released by AI company Anthropic, based in San Francisco, California â scored about 60%. âThe rate of progress is pretty shocking to a lot of people, me included,â Rein adds. âItâs quite difficult to make a benchmark that survives for more than a few years.â
As performance is skyrocketing, so are costs. GPT-4 â the LLM that powers ChatGPT and that was released in March 2023 by San Francisco-based firm OpenAI â reportedly cost US$78 million to train. Googleâs chatbot Gemini Ultra, launched in December, cost $191 million. Many people are concerned about the energy use of these systems, as well as the amount of water needed to cool the data centres that help to run them. âThese systems are impressive, but theyâre also very inefficient,â Maslej says.
Costs and energy use for AI models are high in large part because one of the main ways to make current systems better is to make them bigger. This means training them on ever-larger stocks of text and images. The AI Index notes that some researchers now worry about running out of training data. Last year, according to the report, the non-profit research institute Epoch projected that we might exhaust supplies of high-quality language data as soon as this year. (However, the instituteâs most recent analysis suggests that 2028 is a better estimate.)
Ethical concerns about how AI is built and used are also mounting. âPeople are way more nervous about AI than ever before, both in the United States and across the globe,â says Maslej, who sees signs of a growing international divide. âThere are now some countries very excited about AI, and others that are very pessimistic.â
In the United States, the report notes a steep rise in regulatory interest. In 2016, there was just one US regulation that mentioned AI; last year, there were 25. âAfter 2022, thereâs a massive spike in the number of AI-related bills that have been proposedâ by policymakers, Maslej says.
Regulatory action is increasingly focused on promoting responsible AI use. Although benchmarks are emerging that can score metrics such as an AI toolâs truthfulness, bias and even likability, not everyone is using the same models, Maslej says, which makes cross-comparisons hard. âThis is a really important topic,â he says. âWe need to bring the community together on this.â

These healthy spreads are brimming withÂ vitamins and minerals, and theyâre available in enough flavors to appeal to nearly every palate.
âThe variety of nut butters allow us to have more options, resulting in a greater variety of nutrients in our diet,â says Katie Hake, RD. If you donât love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, there are plenty of other ways to eat nut butter. You canÂ bake with it, add it toÂ smoothies, soups and more.
Some research has shown nut butter consumption is associated with a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes in women. Other research found people who regularly consume nuts have a lower risk of heart disease. While the nutritional profile of each nut butter varies depending on its main ingredient, all forms can be beneficial to your health (for those who donât have allergies).
âNut butters provideÂ healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and plant-based compounds important for good health,â says Marie Spano, MS, RD, sports nutritionist for the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Falcons. AndÂ a little goes a long wayÂ since nut butters average about 200 calories per 2 tablespoon serving.
When youâre at the grocery store and trying to look for the healthiest option, keep in mind you should look for ones that âhave the shortest list of ingredients, because our bodies can process them better,â says Sandra ArÃ©valo, RD, a New York-based spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Try to find a brand that doesnât haveÂ added sugar,Â sodiumÂ or other additives.
Here, RDs weigh in on seven great nut butters to include in your diet:

This tried-and-true product isnât technically a nut butter, since peanuts are considered legumes. Nonetheless, itâs the most commonly consumed nut butter in the U.S., with the longest history on supermarket shelves. It holds a distinction among the nut butters: âPeanut butter tends to be the highest inÂ protein, compared to its competitors,â says Hake. Itâs also rich in vitamin E, vitamin B6 and a number of minerals, includingÂ magnesiumÂ and potassium. âIt can help combat cholesterol and improve conditions such as anemia [and] heart disease,â says ArÃ©valo. Itâs also super versatile, making it easy to pair with something like a banana for aÂ well-balanced snack.

âAlmond butterÂ has become more popular over the years, due to its more unique texture and taste,â says Hake. âJust two tablespoons can provide important minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and potassium.â Itâs also rich in vitamin E, âwhich is great for the maintenance of healthy skin, and contains copper and phosphorus which help improve bone strength,â adds ArÃ©valo.

Although itâs technically a seed, this spread is âa great option for those with tree nut or peanut allergies,â says Spano. âItâs an excellent source of pantothenic acid, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese. It is also a good source of protein, folate and zinc.â
Whatâs more, sunflower seed butter may be particularly beneficial for women. âSunflower seeds have high amounts of B6 and magnesium that have been linked to reduction of cardiovascular disease, menstruation difficulties and premenstrual syndrome,â explains ArÃ©valo.

When you think hazelnut, you may be tempted to reach for a jar of Nutella. Instead, look for natural varieties without the chocolate, salt and excess sugar. âHazelnut butter is an excellent source of vitamin E, copper and manganese and also contains thiamin and magnesium,â says Spano.
This nut butter is also rich in folic acid and potassium, which âaids theÂ production of hormonesÂ and helps reduce the risk of certain cancers,â ArÃ©valo says. âIt can even helpÂ reduce high blood pressure.â

If youâre looking for a lower-calorie option, try pistachio butter. âItâs a good source of protein and lower in fat than most other butters,â says Spano. âIt also contains thiamin, vitamin B6, phosphorous, copper and manganese.â

âWalnut butter contains the highest amounts ofÂ omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial to both brain andÂ heart health,â says Hake. It can have a creamier, thicker texture compared to other nut butters, but pairs nicely with spices like cinnamon.

âCashews are rich in many B vitamins like B12, B1 and B5, which help correct metabolic disorders,â says ArÃ©valo. âPay attention to how much you consumeÂ though, because it is the highest in calories.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:58,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/sheena-zadeh-kosas-beauty-routine/,"Sheena Zadeh, Founder, Kosas",2042,"âI did my undergrad in biology. Pretty much right after graduating college, I had a moment where it became clear to me that my truest desire was to have my own beauty brand. I knew that I had a strong point of view on color, formula, makeup, and the overall approach to beauty because I was everyoneâs go-to beauty person growing up. I was the one that you would go to and ask, âIâm going somewhere. Can you do my makeup? What lipstick should I buy? How do I do this? What are the steps?â I ended up going to business school not long after coming to this realization. I graduated during the Great Recession and had a really rough time. I couldnât find any work, and I still had this love affair with color, so I decided to spend some time doing the one final thing that I hadnât really gotten a chance to do, which was working with a fine artist in Los Angeles and getting an art education. Then I was at a crossroads and had to ask myself if I wanted to pursue fine art as a career or start this beauty brand that Iâd had inside of me for so many years.
I didnât go into Kosas with a big brand plan or marketing strategy. It started with lipstick. I was always reaching for that âyour lips but betterâ shade, but it was hard with my olive skin tone. I wanted shades that look truly humanânot beige, but actual flesh tones. I also wanted to formulate products in a very specific way. I wanted to put those two things together and put it out in the world with so much love and intention. The name of the brand is actually based on the Vedic philosophy of koshas. The word kosha literally translates to sheath in Sanskrit, and according to the philosophy, there are five layers to the self and your essenceâyour true capital âSâ self, not the self that we put out in the worldâemanates outward into your appearance. Essentially, beauty is a reflection of who you truly are. And thatâs very much the story I want to tell with Kosas. I received a lot of messaging from the beauty industry about covering or fixing myself and that never resonated with me. I think that itâs very natural for us to want to express ourselves to reveal who we truly are. I do actually think we have done that.

SKINCARE
I approach skincare really carefully because I have incredibly acne-prone and highly reactive skin. Cleansing is the most important thing to me, especially with all the makeup I wear every day. I double cleanse at night. Bioderma Sensibio H2O is the best micellar waterâit can cut through so many layers of makeup. I use it with cotton ovals that are kind of large. Thatâs really important because they give me a very gentle physical exfoliation. The Paulaâs Choice Resist cleanser is very, very light but really thorough without being stripping. It also has ceramides, which are great for your skin barrier. Sometimes Iâll layer on an oil or a balm cleanser, like Living Libationsâ Seabuckthorn Best Skin Ever, if I need to triple cleanse.
Angelia Caglia has given me facials before, and she has a really gentle approach to skin. I discovered her Cell FortÃ© serum within the last six months, and itâs remarkable. My skin was more toned and smooth right after the first use. Itâs a huge splurge, but itâs made with human stem cellsâI use it to the very last drop. It was also love at first sight with Shani Dardenâs plumping serum. I quit using traditional moisturizers maybe two or three years agoâI naturally have large pores and quite a bit of texture, and traditional heavier moisturizers were almost enlarging my pores. Once I stepped using them, I saw a lot of improvement. The plumping serum has enough hydration for me with the glycerin and snow mushroom. Honestly though, Iâll use it maybe once a week. And I use Joanna Czechâs C+ serum maybe twice a month because it can be really sensitizing for me. Twice is enough for my skin to get the brightening effect that I want. The serum that I do use regularly is our Kosas Plump + Juicy serum. I formulated it for my own skin type. If I ever see anyone with an active breakout, Iâm like, âQuit everything, only double cleanse and use our serum spray.â Thatâs my takeâand it works. It has artemisia flower extract, which is highly soothing, peptides for healing, and probiotics to support your skinâs microbiome. And I only recently started using eye cream. I never thought the day would come; Itâs almost like you donât know youâre going to age until it happens. Iâve been using Relevant Beautyâs Beam + Glow eye serum. Itâs not heavy or greasy like other eye creams Iâve tried, which gave me milia.

If I had to go to a deserted island, I would take the Kosas DreamBeam sunscreen with me. It has 21.7% zinc. I formulated it when I put my daughter in surf camp over the summer. They wouldnât let her go in the water unless her face was completely covered in zinc; if you want to know what works, ask a surfer. They wouldnât accept other kinds of sunscreenâand they were even specific about which zinc-based sunscreens the kids used because it had to have a specific concentration of zinc. Zinc is tough because itâs very white, so it almost reflects a blue purple on your skin. We added a peachy-pink hue to neutralize that to an extent, and itâs certainly minimized, but itâs not going to completely disappear. Itâs a great base for makeup. Honestly, I never wore sunscreen before DreamBeam, even though itâs the one thing that youâre supposed to wear. It broke me out and it made my makeup look bad, so I just wouldnât. DreamBeam really hits all of my criteria: It feels good, it works well under makeup, and it does not cause any breakouts.
And then I love my Nuface. Whenever Iâm consistent with itâif I actually use it two or three days a week for even five or 10 minutesâit feels like my face is getting a workout. I have been wanting to get a Ziip because of the different face exercises on their app. I love the founder, Melanie Simon. Speaking of face workouts, I love FaceGym. I feel like I can never get a deep enough face massage, and this is the one place where theyâre fully dedicated to it. There are so many muscles in our faces and we carry so much tension. Thereâs one close to my house, so Iâve started going once a month. The last time I went, I did a cryo treatment and loved it. I was so smooth and bright for weeks after.
MAKEUP
After sunscreen, I do one pump of BB Burst in Medium Warm 24 all over. Then I add on a second laterâI very strongly believe in working in multiple thin layers. I use our concealer in 3.8 under my eyes. Iâm always after plumpness and lift for my overall look, and concealer is definitely a part of shaping that antigravity. [Laughs] I use quite a bit of Cloud Set setting powder in Feathery and Comfy because it gives you this beautiful filter without flattening your face. Then I use a huge amount of Sun Show bronzer in Beachy because I can also sculpt and lift with it.

For my brows, I do either two or three steps. I use Brow Pop Nano in Dark Brown and feather the top of the tail of my brow because that also creates a bit of a lift. I leave the front of my brow completely naked to prevent boxiness. Then I use Air Brow gel in Medium Brown mostly on the tail end of my brow and Air Brow in Clear on the front part so it doesnât look heavy.
I started wearing eyeshadow a year and a half ago, and itâs been life-changing for me. I believe very strongly in maximizing every feature, and for many years, I wasnât doing that. I wasnât allowing myself the time to concentrate on my eyes, and I was also afraid of looking too much, so eyeshadow scared me. But when I started using the Undressed palette, I felt like I was finally maximizing all of my real estate. Thatâs how I felt about my lips, too. Right now, my obsession is our Wet Sticks. They have a beautiful balm-y texture. I have several favorite shades, including 100 Degrees, and I grab one depending on how I feel. Then of course, I always have a LipFuel in Baseline around.
HAIR
I regularly get a cut and color from Tauni Dawson. Thatâs the basis for everything. I wash my hair every two to three days, and I only use Davines MOMO shampoo and Heart of Glass conditioner. Iâm so minimal with hair products because my hair gets weighed down easily, and I also have acne-prone body skin, which most hair products exacerbate. I use a Dyson hair dryer to blow it out, and I do a soft wave with the T3 Curl X 1.5â curling iron.
NAILS
Brittany Boyce of Nails of LA has completely changed my relationship with my nails. She gives me a builder gel manicure in her signature almond shape. Itâs so flattering and makes me feel so feminine. I instantly feel more put together when I have my nails done, so Iâm religious about it. Itâs bizarre because getting the manicure is not that short of a processâitâs like two hours every time. I tend to go towards more neutral shades, usually some variation of white, pink, or a beige that matches my skin tone. When I feel like having color, Brittany lets me mix my own shade. Itâs so fun. I love a very specific red with just the right amount of fuschia or orange. Then one of my favorite tricks is to put a matte coat on top. Something about a matte reddish fuchsia nail is very powerful.

FRAGRANCE
I am obsessed with the scent of leather, sandalwood, vanilla, and tobacco. My dad had pipes growing up, and I have a very strong childhood memory of going into his room just for the smell. Also, if I close my eyes and smell sandalwood, I swear to God I go to another realm. I only started wearing fragrance again because I discovered Sunlit Blooms from DedCool. Iâm obsessed with it. It has a sort of grounded sweetness, but itâs not sugary sweet. It smells like if you go under sheets and you see the sunlight coming through, like the feeling of being in love. I recently got Haunted Rose from Future Society. The premise of the company is really cool. They sequence the DNA of extinct flowers to create scents. That drew me in, but a story is never enough. It really has to smell good, too, and when I picked it up, it kind of hit at the heart. I normally canât stand much in the way of florals, but it has a good balance.
I also really love the smell of amber, and Sacred + Divine has a 333 candle thatâs beautiful. And I love the packaging of the Diptyque Baies candle. Itâs an all-black vessel, and it gives me such joy. Itâs very soft and never overwhelming. I keep it in my bedroom.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:05,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/empress-of-for-your-consideration-tour-beauty-routine/,"Empress Of, Musician",1051,"âIâm getting ready to go on tour to support my fourth album, For Your Consideration. I think itâs sonically one of my most fun records. Heartbreak and relationships were major inspirations for my last albums, but this one is so flirty and sexy and makes me feel good in my body. Itâs the perfect single-era album; I feel hot when I listen to it. Youâre going to want to put it on when youâre doing your makeup.
Getting ready is really meditative for me. I like the stillness of it before the chaos, especially now that Iâm going to more events and red carpets as an artist. If I have the luxury of taking my time, I have a playlist thatâs six hours long and filled with music that pumps me up. It has a ton of bops from people like Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, and Kate Bush.
Iâve definitely gotten better at doing my own looks since I donât always have a makeup artist on tour with me. Iâve learned so much from TikTok and Instagram. Itâs a creative process. I love asking myself who I want to be that night, but the goal is always to feel more confident when Iâm on stage.
SKINCARE
The biggest thing Iâve learned from watching makeup artistsâI love working with Nick Lennon, Alexandra French, and Marla Vazquezâis that skin prep is so important. When Iâm getting ready for the night, I start off with The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5. It feels good on my skin, but I also like it because of the price point; itâs just under $10. I really like the Osea Essential Hydrating Oil because itâs really light and actually absorbs into the skin. It smells really nice, kind of sweet and fruity. And the Osea Ocean Eye Serum is great, too. The Augustinus Bader Cream is painfully expensive but very worth the investment. When I run out, I try to convince myself to use other moisturizers, but then they never live up to it. Itâs just very hydrating and calming for my skin. It sinks in wellâbut I really hate spending $300 on it.

MAKEUP
Iâm just so happy to have nailed one makeup look that I keep doing it over and over againâa little bit of contour on my cheeks, forehead, and nose, and a snatched, chocolate-y eye look. I started using Urban Decayâs Eyeshadow Primer because it makes colors pop more on stage, not to mention Iâm constantly moving and sweating. I love Urban Decayâs Naked3 Palette, too. I actually use the darkest color to line my eyes. The MAC In Extreme Dimension 3D Mascara is another classic. I like a messy, 60s mascara look sometimes, and I can really get that look with it because the wand picks up a lot of product.
If Armani ever reads this, please sponsor me. [Laughs] I love their Luminous Silk Foundation. Itâs so good. Iâve heard from some makeup artists that foundation is really skin-dependent, and this one has really worked for me for years. I use shade 9.
The Charlotte Tilbury Glow Cream Bronzer in 2 Medium is the best in the game. I see it in every makeup artistâs kit. Itâs so subtle and very pretty. I contour with the Fenty Beauty Contour Match Stix in Mocha. Itâs so easy to make lines with them, especially around the nose.
All of Rare Beautyâs products are sick, but I keep buying the Melting Cream Blush in Nearly Berry. Itâs so pigmented and itâs a fun size, so you can carry it in your purse and just use your finger to dab it on your cheeks when you need a re-up. Iliaâs DayLite Highlighting Powder in Decades is so great for the edge of the nose and cheekbones. Itâs just slightly shimmery, so itâs not at all overwhelming.  And red lips make me feel really good. I love combining NARS Lip Liner in African Queen and NARS Pure Matte Lipstick in 414 BLKR. I set everything with the Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder. It blurs everything in a really pretty and natural way.

HAIR
I usually put extensions in my hair when I play a lot of shows. They really add to the dramaâand itâs great to have hair to whip around. Antoine Martinez does my hair sometimes, and Iâm nowhere near as good as he is, but I put in my own extensions now. I just try to imitate what he does. Then I go in with my Hot Tools Â¾â 24K Gold Curling Iron. I like using EcoStylerâs Olive Oil Styling Gel to tame the top of my head because I donât like big, frizzy, curly hair. I was actually really surprised when I saw that my stylist was using it because itâs like $4, but hey, if it works, it works.
FRAGRANCE
When Iâm getting ready, I love lighting Astier de Villateâs Palais de Tokyo Incense. Thatâs such a âme moment,â and it makes my place smell like a really nice hotel lobby, which makes me feel luxurious. I get so many compliments when I wear Debaser from D.S. & Durga. It has coconut milk, iris, and bergamot. The brand describes it as âhot, humid, and sexy,â kind of like my album. [Laughs] I layer it with my Nuxe Dry Oil. I had seen it on so many peopleâs dressers, and I finally bought it when I played a show in Paris. Itâs a classic, and the older I get the more that I want classic products. I mean, I wonât wear Chanel. No. 5, but I do like the idea of it.â

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:19:09,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/are-mocktails-healthy-what-a-dietitian-wants-you-to-know/,Are Mocktails Healthy? What a Dietitian Wants You to Know,371,"Mocktails, which are non-alcoholic alternatives to cocktails, have gained popularity as a refreshing and sociable beverage choice. The rise of the sober curiosity trend since 2018 has played a significant role in the increased interest in mocktails. This trend, coupled with initiatives like Dry January, has encouraged more people to explore and enjoy the world of alcohol-free drinks. But are mocktails healthy?
We had the opportunity to sit down with Daisy Mercer, a dietitian who works with MyFitnessPal, to gain insights into the nutritional aspects of mocktails and how they fit into a balanced diet.
Mercer appreciates mocktails as an excellent substitute for alcoholic beverages, especially in social settings. âMocktails are a great alternative to alcohol. Many social gatherings revolve around drinking, and it can be uncomfortable for someone not drinking if they donât have a drink in hand.â
So, in other words, yes, mocktails can definitely be healthy alternatives to cocktails or other alcoholic beverages â but there are nuances to understand.
What makes mocktails âhealthyâ
What to look out for when buying or making mocktails
Numerous studies corroborate the health advantages of mocktails:
There are tons you can buy at the grocery store or make at home. But here are a few we recommend starting with if youâre new to the mocktail-making scene:
Or choose from 12 additional mocktail recipes. Weâre also sharing some mocktail inspo on our TikTok and Instagram.
Choosing mocktails over their alcoholic counterparts generally aligns with health and wellness goals. Just remember to make informed choices, read nutrition labels â specifically paying attention to caloric and added sugar content â and sip easy knowing youâre making a decision that aligns with your health goals. (You probably wonât miss the hangovers, either!)

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:19:10,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/ask-the-rd-whats-the-healthiest-cooking-oil/,Ask the RD: Whatâs the Healthiest Cooking Oil?,1080,"Cooking oilsÂ differ in nutrients, flavor profile, and the level of heat they can withstand, which is why it can be helpful to include a variety in your diet. Like other food products, there can be misinformation floating around, especially when fat content is unfairly demonized.Â FatÂ is an essentialÂ macronutrientÂ theÂ body requiresÂ for cell growth, absorption of important nutrients like vitamin B and energy.
Moreover, cooking nutrient-rich foods like vegetables and lean proteins in oil helps them caramelize, browning the natural sugar and amino acids, so they have more depth and flavor and keep you satiated longer. Fat can also add creaminess to things like salad dressings, so theyâre enjoyable, and you donât feel a need to mindlessly snack after a meal.
Hereâs a look at five popular cooking oils and how they compare nutritionally:

Avocado oilÂ has gained popularity in recent years, and rightfully so. It is pressed from avocados, and, like olive oil, is high in the heart-healthy monounsaturated fat oleic acid. Avocado oil is also rich in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant. For the most health benefits, choose unrefined, cold-pressed avocado oil.
Avocado oil has a higher smoke point (around 480Â°F or 248Â°C) than olive oil and is better suited for high-heat cooking. Because of its pleasant flavor, avocado oil is also excellent as aÂ salad dressing baseÂ or used in an aioli to accompany veggies.

Canola oil was developed in Canada (and thatâs how it got its name, CANola), by crossbreeding the rapeseed plant to contain fewer toxic compounds. Canola oil is considered ârefined,â meaning it goes through more chemical processing during production, which may have an effect on the fatty acid quality and reduce the nutrient content. However, it contains both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Itâs also high in linoleic acid, which is an omega-6 fatty acid.
WhileÂ omega-6 fatsÂ are important, they can be inflammatory if consumed in disproportionately higher amounts thanÂ omega-3 fatty acids. The typical Western diet is much higher in omega-6 fats compared to omega-3 fats (which can be found in whole foods like fatty fish, walnuts and flaxseeds), partly because canola oil can be found in a large variety of processed foods.
Canola oil has a high smoke point (400Â°F or 204Â°C) and can be used for high-heat cooking. Because it has a mild, neutral flavor, it can be used in a variety of cooking methods such as sauteing, stir-frying, grilling and baking.

Coconut oil had its moment in the sun a few years ago, and though its popularity seems to have slowed, it can still be an occasional tool in the kitchen. It is made by pressing fresh coconut meat and extracting the oil, and the least processed version is typically labeled virgin or cold-pressed as opposed to refined. Unlike other cooking oils, coconut consists primarily of saturated fat, so it is solid at room temperature. Itâs a bit different from the saturated fat found in animal products like butter, however, because some of the saturated fat in coconut oil is a medium-chain fatty acid called lauric acid. It is thought that lauric acid is absorbed more quickly by the body and used for energy, as opposed to being stored as fat. Regardless, numerous studies have found coconut oil may contribute to elevated LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides, so it shouldnât be considered a heart-healthy oil. Coconut oil does not contain significant amounts of other vitamins, minerals or macronutrients.
Coconut oil has a smoke point of around 375â400Â°F or 190â204Â°C. It should be used occasionally when and if it makes sense. For example, it can add a nice flavor to sautÃ©ed vegetables, curry dishes and as a substitute for butter in some baking recipes.

Olive oil is also a good source of vitamins E and K, which support heart and bone health, respectively. Olive oil is derived from olives, which are pressed to extract oil. Extra virgin oil is the least processed form of olive oil and the most nutritious because of its antioxidant content; it also has the richest flavor. Olive oil is a good source of monounsaturated fats, especially oleic acid, which is important for cardiac health, reducing inflammation and may help lower LDL and total cholesterol. Consuming a Mediterranean dietÂ rich in olive oil may also help reduce the risk of breast cancer, as found in a large randomized clinical trial.
Olive oil has a smoke point of around 350â410Â°F (176â210Â°C) and can be used for sauteing and frying at medium-high heat, roasting veggies and as a base for salad dressings thanks to its delicious flavor.

Sunflower oil is made from pressing the oil from sunflower seeds. It is an excellent source of vitamin E, and is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Like canola oil, sunflower oil is high in omega-6 fatty acids, and when consumed frequently and in much higher amounts than omega-3 fats, it can be inflammatory. However, many sunflower oilsÂ contain higher amounts of oleic acid (a monounsaturated fat), which may have similar heart health benefits as compared to other high oleic acid oils.
Sunflower oil has a high smoke point, 450Â°F (232Â°C), and can be used for high-heat cooking. It has a mild flavor and can be used in a variety of sautes, stir-fries and even baking recipes.
If youâre looking for the most nutrient-dense option,Â olive oil has the most scientific research backing its numerous health benefits. That said, itâs always important to include variety in your dietÂ and take into account what youâre making, the heat level you need for cooking, and the desired flavor profile when choosing which oil to use. Having a couple of options in your kitchen arsenal is the best way toÂ keep your diet exciting and enjoyable.

A âComputerâ Built from DNA Can Find Patterns in Photographs
Artificial DNA sorts images like a neural network does
By Allison Parshall
Thomas Fuchs
Brains are the quintessential decision-makers, gathering and weighing information before choosing a path forward. But in the natural world, many simpler systems accomplish similar tasks. Cells use networks of chemical signals to determine when to reproduce or die. Even water could be said to âdecideâ whether it will freeze into a snowflake or a hailstone, given the transformationâs exceedingly complex physics, says Erik Winfree, a molecular computing researcher at the California Institute of Technology.
Winfree has long been intrigued by the physical worldâs hidden information-processing abilities. For a recent study in Nature, he and his collaborators designed a group of artificial DNA strands that, together, can recognize patterns and categorize information. The system bears key similarities to the âneural networkâ algorithms that underpin many artificial-intelligence models.
To build computerlike circuits with biological machinery, researchers often turn to self-assembling DNA molecules. These customized strands (or âtilesâ) of DNA, when combined in a test tube and cooled, assemble into predictably shaped mosaics that can convey information.

The scientists wanted to know whether that type of setup could recognize patternsâsuch as by sorting grayscale photographs into categories. To represent images in a test tube, the scientists created a code in which each image pixel corresponded to a particular âshapeâ of DNA tile. The lighter a pixel, the more of its corresponding DNA tile would be present in the solution.
When cooled, the tiles snapped together like a self-assembling jigsaw puzzle into one of three possible shapes, depending on the balance of DNA tile shapes in the mixture. Each shape represented a category, explains co-author Constantine Glen Evans, a molecular computing researcher now at Maynooth University in Ireland.
The system was built to sort 18 photos into three arbitrary categories, but it could also classify images it had never seen before, such as distorted versions of the same pictures. Like a neural network, it recognized general similarities in images ârather than looking for an exact match,â says co-author Arvind Murugan, a physicist at the University of Chicago.
The research is intended not to be an alternative to neural networks themselves but instead to reveal the computational abilities âthat matter already has,â Murugan says. The scientists hope to find similar computational abilities within other systems in nature; such abilities âcould be hidden in all kinds of things that we donât notice,â Murugan says.
âItâs just intrinsically interesting,â says biomolecular engineer Rebecca Schulman of Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the new research. The fact that information can be stored implicitly through the interactions of large groups of molecules, similarly to how itâs stored in large groups of neurons in a neural network, âis something that I have never seen before,â she says.
The findings are like a first, fleeting glimpse at an âexoticâ deep-sea ecosystem, Schulman adds. âItâs maybe a calling to go back and look harder.â

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:18:59,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/whats-healthier-white-or-dark-meat-chicken/,Is White or Dark Meat Chicken Healthier?,716,"Whether youâre trying toÂ lose weightÂ or gain muscle, both white and dark meat chicken can be a healthy staple in many diets â and for good reason. âChicken is a wonderful source ofÂ protein,â saysÂ Mascha Davis, MPH, RD, a Los Angeles-based dietitian. âBecause it comes from animal muscle, it has all of theÂ essential amino acidsÂ humans need to stay healthy.â Plus, that protein has high bioavailability â meaning your body easily absorbs it and uses it for various functions â because the quality and amino acid distribution closely mimics ours, she explains.
Moreover, chicken is rich in key minerals and vitamins such as iron, zinc, B vitamins and selenium. So, including white or dark meat chicken in your diet may help boost your health. But whether you opt for white or dark meat might depend on your goals.
Here, nutritionists weigh in on the pros and cons to consider the next time youâre deciding whether to eat white meat or dark meat chicken.

Compared to dark meat chicken, white meat is lower in fat and slightly higher in niacin, a B vitamin that helps convert food to energy. âGiven that a chicken breast has a fairly low calorie density for the amount of protein provided, consuming chicken may promote weight loss or weight maintenance,â saysÂ Georgia Rounder, RD.
On the other hand, three ounces of roasted, skinless dark-meat chicken meat contains more calories, fat and less protein. However, because itâs higher in myoglobin than white meat, dark meat chicken has more iron and zinc. And because itâs higher in fat, it has about twice as many healthyÂ omega-3 fatty acidsÂ as white meat, Davis says.
âWhite meat is actually less nutrient-rich than dark meat,â notes Rounder. âMyoglobin is the special protein that determines the color of the chicken meat. The more myoglobin, the darker the meat and the more nutrient-rich the piece of meat is,â she explains.
White meat chicken is a blank slate when it comes to flavoring and cooking. You can marinate it, coat it in spice rub, slather it in a healthy sauce or top it with salsa or compote. You can also prepare it in many healthy ways, such as roasting, baking, grilling or stir-frying. âWhite meat chicken is a very versatile protein and a great option for people looking toÂ lower the amount of saturated fatÂ in their diet forÂ heart health reasons,â Davis says.
While dark meat is just as versatile when it comes to cooking and seasoning as white meat, the higher fat content gives dark meat a richer, juicier flavor and texture, Rounder points out. Itâs also usually cheaper than white meat.
âBoth versions of chicken are good to incorporate into your diet due to the volume of nutrients they provide,â Rounder says. âThe decision ultimately depends on your personal health goals.â For example, if you are watching fat, you may want to primarily eat white meat with some dark meat here and there.
However, yourÂ budget also matters. âVery often, the most economical and delicious option is to buy a whole chickenÂ with the intent of eating every part,â Davis says. âDepending on the types of fat in your overall diet that day or that week and what tastes good to you, you may want to choose one part of the chicken over the other.â
Regardless, itâs best to avoid the skin, which is high in unhealthy fat and calories (about 1.5 grams of saturated fat and 40 calories per three ounces of meat).

How a New AI Model Helps Volcanic History Rise from the Ashes
Volcano detectives use artificial intelligence to sleuth out ancient secrets in Alaska.
By Emily Schwing
Smithsonian/Getty Images
Emily Schwing: In 1912 a volcano in Alaska more than blew its top. Known as Novarupta, it was responsible for the most powerful volcanic eruption of the 20th century.
Kristi Wallace: The reason we care about the big eruptions [is] because theyâre also the ones that scale to the biggest hazards and biggest impacts, both locally and regionallyâsometimes globally.
Schwing: Kristi Wallace is a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

Wallace: We often donât have access to the deep history, the old history. We only have the last 10,000 or 12,000 years; glaciers wiped everything else away. And so, because we canât study those, we canât really speak to the biggest eruptions through the history of the volcano.
Schwing: Now scientists believe theyâve found a way to sleuth out the deep history of volcanoes such as Novarupta, and theyâre doing it with artificial intelligence.
Youâre listening to Scientific Americanâs Science, Quickly. Iâm Emily Schwing.
[Clip: Show theme music]
Schwing: Novarupta dramatically reworked the surrounding landscape and buried nearby communities in more than two feet of ash. Novarupta is a volcano six miles away from another powerful volcano, Mount Katmai. And this wasnât the only time one of these volcanoes proved itself a powerful and dramatic volcanic force.
Jordan Lubbers: When we applied our model to 800,000 years of ash layers in the Gulf of Alaska, we saw that Katmai was responsible for producing a lot of the eruption deposits in marine cores going back to 800,000 years, and they looked almost identical geochemically to the 1912 eruption.
Schwing: Jordan Lubbers is a third-year postdoctoral fellow and geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. And those ash layers heâs talking aboutâtheyâre called tephras.
Lubbers: So we have a lot of tephra layers in the Gulf of Alaska that we donât know where they came from.
Schwing: Jordan says tephras are like a volcanoâs fingerprint.
Lubbers: So can we, can we identify a way that these volcanoes all have their own unique kind of geochemical fingerprint and then use that fingerprint to apply to ash layers that we donât know the source volcano to kind of better reconstruct a long-term volcanic history of Alaska and the surrounding region?
Schwing: There have been lots of large tephra-producing eruptions in Alaska and northwestern Canada. But theyâre hard to get to.
Lubbers: A lot of the locations that weâre going to to research these volcanoes are not accessible by road, which means either plane or helicopter travel or something like that. So the fieldwork is, is quite challenging, and so I guess that makes us somewhat sample-limited in that we donât, we donât have as much information as maybe we would like from these volcanoes because we donât have a lot of time to go for boots on the ground at these volcanoes to learn about them.
Schwing: And thereâs another challenge: when glaciers started to retreat at the end of the last glacial maximum, they wiped away evidence of large tephra-producing eruptions in the Far North.
You can think of Jordan and his colleague Kristi as volcano detectives. They are trying to link tephras with their source volcanoes. Now theyâre using machine learning - AIâas their magnifying glass. Theyâve created a model that uses existing data from tephras.
Wallace: And then [we] use this machine-learning technique to say, âOkay, this is whatâs erupted in the last 10,000 years. Can you train the model to tell us where these much older deposits come from?â Hundreds of thousands of years old, potentially. âDo they link back to these same volcanoes?â And then we can go back to thatâletâs say Katmai or any one of our 130 volcanoes that weâre dealing withâcan we then really tell the true story of the volcano?
Schwing: Their findings were published in November 2023 in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems.
Jordan says using AI also means they have a more accurate way to differentiate among individual volcanoes.
Lubbers: A lot of, a lot of these volcanoes are quite similar. And the human eye or, like, classical statistics might confuse them and mix these things up. But what machine learning basically allows us to do is kind of think about things in many more dimensions, and we give it the data from all these volcanoes, and then we give it the answers that we knowâlike we collected this sample from this volcano, so we know that thatâs where it erupted from. Now come up with a set of rules to then tell us what makes all these volcanoes unique. And thatâs really the power here, is that itâs able to better classify unknown eruptions.
Schwing: Both Jordan and Kristi say they will continue training their model to strengthen its accuracy and to better understand AI-generated answers to their source volcano inquiries.
Jordan says work like this is useful not only in Alaska and the surrounding region, but anywhere volcanic activity is a known threat to public safety.
Lubbers: All volcanic arcs are slightly different. And so this is what a machine-learning model would figure out. It would figure out maybe a new set of rules thatâs different for the Andes, thatâs different for Sumatra, thatâs different for Kamchatka, thatâs different for Italy. But with proper data handling and, you know, good, good sorts of logical tests and expert, expert kind of opinions from geologists in that area, thereâs no reason that this can't be applied elsewhere.
Schwing: And Kristi says the new tool could also be useful across disciplines in the scientific research community.
Wallace: When youâre looking at tephra deposits, they represent an isochron, so a single time in history. Itâs instantaneous. It falls to the ground, and it tells you time, it gives you a sense [that] something happened at a specific time, and basically they link marine records [and] lacustrine records in lakes with terrestrial records. And so that helps you to understand, you know, ice ages and climactic events or archaeological time frames or when people were moving around. Thereâs all sorts of context that it could put things into.
Schwing: And that context could be key to a new understanding of how massive eruptions like the one at Novarupta changed life for the people who lived through them.
Wallace: This is the first time that the geochemical data has been published. And so now people who are working all across the state, even globally, have access to these data, and they can now correlate the tephras back to a location and an age. Thatâs really, really powerful.
Schwing: Maybe even as powerful as the volcanic eruptions themselves.

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:18:56,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/the-health-benefits-of-chocolate/,The Health Benefits of Chocolate,1271,"Itâs chocolate season! With Valentineâs Day just around the corner, the deep, dark, delicious sweet treat is splashing its way across the shelves and corners of nearly every food market and gift shop. The benefits of chocolate are touted across packaging and headlined in countless articles (including this one) â but is chocolate really a superfood measuring up alongside blueberries, green tea and chia seeds?
Hereâs what we know: Numerous studies have found dark chocolate to be highly nutritious and rich in antioxidants with the potential to improve blood flow, lower blood pressure, raise good HDL cholesterol, lower the risk of heart disease, enhance skin quality, reduce inflammation, and even improve blood flow to the brain. In fact, chocolate wasÂ historicallyÂ eaten for its purported healing properties.
Americans spend billions (more than $20 billion, to be exact) of dollars on chocolate annually. So, does that equate to billions of touted health benefits?
Not exactly.
You have to eatÂ a lotÂ of commercially available chocolate to reap the benefits. And you know what comes with a lot of commercial chocolate? A lot of calories.
Chocolate (like most things) is healthiest in its most whole, pure form. However, most chocolate does not come packaged this way.
All chocolate (dark, milk, nibs, bars, chips, cocoa powder, cacao, and yes, even white) begins its journey as a fruit on the cacao tree. The seeds that grow inside these fruits are called cacao (also cocoa) beans. Once harvested, these seeds are fermented, dried, and then roasted to develop flavor. The inner nibs are the true star â nutty and earthy with a crunchy texture. In most of the chocolate bars and products available to consumers, the nibs are ground to create a chocolate liquor (which has nothing to do with a cocktail) which then gets mixed with sugar, milk powders, and other ingredients like lecithin, spices and vanilla to create different flavors and textures.
So, is there a way to work chocolate into a balanced, healthy diet? Yes, but itâs not exactly as simple as nibbling on a chocolate bar. The more the chocolate gets mashed, blended and processed, the less potent its power.
1. ANTIOXIDANT POWER
Flavonoids are a type of polyphenol found naturally in plants that help protect them from environmental toxins and repair damage. Theyâre extra potent antioxidants and found highly concentrated in cocoa beans (a fruit!). In high doses, theseÂ powerful compounds carry anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties, which may prevent cellular damage. More than 10%Â of the weight of cocoa powder is flavonoids â thatâs rich!
2. HEART HELPERS
Flavonols are the main flavonoid found in cocoa beans. Theyâre also responsible for the bitterness we often taste in raw chocolate. Flavonols are particularly beneficial for the heart, improving blood flow, increasing circulation, reducing the risk of clotting, and potentially lowering blood pressure.
3. GOOD GUT BUILDERS
Two of the most potent flavonols in chocolate areÂ epicatechin and catechin, which increase blood antioxidant activity, decrease oxidative stress, and may even promote better gut health. The presence of both epicatechin and catechin may improve the quality of the bacteria in our gut microbiota,Â increasingÂ our âgood bugsâ and reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria. The darker the chocolate the better, as these effects were reduced when combined with milk.
4. IMMUNITY BOOSTERS
The antioxidants in cocoa beans help reduce oxidative stress by inhibiting and lowering the amount of free radicals in the blood stream. Free radicals have the ability to send our immune systems into overdrive!
5. BRAIN BOOSTERS
Theobromine and caffeine are the mood-and-energy-boosting components found in chocolate. Both of these substancesÂ block adenosine receptors, helping you feel more alert. When adenosine binds to its receptors, it slows neural activity and you begin to feel sleepy. Some studies even say chocolate promotes the production of serotonin (the good mood stabilizer) and also contains phenylalanine (the love molecule). But, the reality is, most of these compounds are found in very small quantities in the chocolate we eat. Itâs more likely the experience we undergo while eating chocolate â that moment of instantly satisfying a food craving â is responsible for the âeuphoriaâ we often feel after nibbling a few bites.
So, can we have our chocolate cake and eat it, too? Yes, but the darker and less sweet the chocolate, the better. Here are the benefits of consuming chocolate in its varied forms.

Cacao nibs, in pure form, are actually one of the healthiest forms of chocolate. Not only are they rich in flavonoids and antioxidants, but cacao nibs are also high in protein and fiber â with 5 grams of fiber and 2.5 grams of protein in just 2 tablespoons of nibs. But they arenât sweet. Cacao nibs contain all of the fiber, fat, and nutrients a cacao bean does. In its raw, rare form, chocolate contains no sugar. All sugar is added in processing. The nibs are earthy and slightly bitter, with a crunch much like coffee beans.

Cocoa powder (and cacao; more on the difference, below) is made by removing cocoa butter from the liquor that comes from crushed nibs. Itâs basically a concentrated source of all those flavonoids and polyphenols! A higher percentage of cocoa powder in chocolate means greater antioxidant potential and power. Unlike most other forms of chocolate, cocoa powder is low in calories (about 12 per tablespoon). Itâs also rich in minerals like magnesium, copper and iron.
Cacao powder is very similar, but closer to its raw state than cocoa powder, as cocoa goes through an additional layer of high-heat roasting and processing. This âDutch processingâ removes some of the bitterness, but also some antioxidants. While both are still incredibly healthy, cacao powder is often considered one of the highest sources of antioxidants you can find!

Hereâs where chocolate starts to get complicated. Every bar is different. Most have a lot of sugar, milk solids, fats and even additives mixed in with the raw, healthy chocolates mentioned above mitigating and diluting most of the benefits. Bars that have more than 70% cacao are going to be the most concentrated sources of flavonoids and polyphenols. A high-quality bar thatâs concentrated can often satisfy a sweet craving in a bite or two, so find a dark bar you love and nibble sensibly.

If you are aiming to increase your antioxidant intake, this category of sweets is not likely the best place to find them! While MyFitnessPal hasÂ quite the libraryÂ of better-for-you baked goods that contain chocolate, you are better off steering clear of foods that contain a lot of added sugars, calories, and refined flours.
Itâs the cocoa bean, in whole form, not the chocolate bar, that carries health benefits. The more processed the chocolate, the fewer the benefits. If you really want to increase your antioxidant intake, work powders and nibs into healthy dishes to boost both flavor and benefits.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:46,https://intothegloss.com/2024/01/rebecca-alaniz-stylist-beauty-routine/,"Rebecca Alaniz, Stylist + Photographer",2809,"âI grew up in a very small town in Texas called Magnoliaâitâs as charming as it sounds. I had no family in fashion whatsoever, but I remember sitting in front of my familyâs desktop during my freshman year of high school and searching for editorials. I didnât even know that word; I was typing phrases like âphotography with dressesâ or âmakeup on models.â My style slowly started to change as I did more research. I got into thrifting during my senior year, and it was through hunting for vintage piecesâand learning how to authenticate themâthat I knew fashion was going to be a part of my life somehow. Even so, I ended up going to college to become a teacher. Education is so important to me, and I thought maybe I could have the best of both worlds by teaching fashion or even just by being a teacher with great style. [Laughs]
When I graduated college, a few doors in my personal life closed, which gave me an opportunity to completely change the trajectory of my life. I loved New York so much and knew that if I didnât move then, I would never get the chance again. I was terrified because I didnât have a job, but through a friend of a friend of a friend, I found someone that was looking for a roommate in the East Village.
CAREER
When I first got to the city, I met with an employment agencyâit was very 'Sex and The City.' All of the agents were wearing hot pink stilettos. I walked in with my resume and met with someone for maybe 10 minutes. As soon as she looked at itâI will never forget thisâshe said, âIt says that you want to be a freelance stylist, that you want to work in editorial, that you want to have personal clients. It seems like your goal is to be the next Rachel Zoe. Well, unfortunately, the best job that we can give you would be at a chain retail store. I see hundreds of girls that want the exact same thing. Please donât take this the wrong way, but itâs not going to happen for you.â I donât know what came over me, but I said, âWell, Iâm going to prove you wrong.â I was shaking and grabbed my resume and left. Then I cried all of the way home.
I used a few connections and got a job working retail at Intermix and later Helmut Lang. Those two years were so hard because I thought I was regressing. I was like, âI did this in Dallas. Thereâs no way I left my entire family to do the exact same thing.â But I had no idea how to be a freelancer.

I later met Carly Cardellino, who was Cosmopolitanâs beauty director, through mutual friends at church, and I explained what I wanted to do. I said, âI donât know what that means for you and how you could help me, but Iâll do anything and Iâll do it for free.â Around that time, I was interning for stylist Sabina Schreder, so I got to help style people like Blake Lively and Scarlett Johansson for magazine covers. Carly told me to send her my profile, and I did. But I didnât hear from anybody for a month. I was convinced they hated it, and I was so embarrassed. But what was happening was that someone bumped up my profile to the central Hearst team. One day, I got a call saying, âSorry for the delay. Everyone loved your portfolio. We have a shoot coming up with Revlon in collaboration with Elle and Cosmopolitan. You would need to style 10 models. Is that something youâre comfortable with?â I was like, âOf course. I shoot 10 models often.â Complete lie. [Laughs] I had three weeks to put it together. I didnât have access to publicists to pull clothing, so I called my ex-bosses at Intermix and Helmut Lang and they pretty much let me ransack their stores. It was a huge success, and from that moment on, I was contracted by Hearst for about five years, which later led to lookbooks and campaigns with brands like Kate Spade, CoverGirl, Neutrogena, J. Crew, and Coach. My work has appeared in other magazines like Vogue, Glamour, and LâOfficiel, too. On the non-editorial end, I work with 10 people, including CEOs, founders, and authors, on a personal styling basis.
I later picked up film and digital photography because I needed to show my own personal work. It was a hobby at first, but itâs now a part of my work, too. I shoot a lot with Babba Canales, one of my styling clients and the founder of hair care brand Ceremonia.
BEAUTY
I have a very personal relationship with beauty through my mom, who is the beauty icon in my life. She always had big, curly hairâand now I love blowouts. She loves long red nails, and those are now my signature. She started dancing Mexican traditional ballet folklÃ³rico when she was five years old, so she grew up wearing makeup from a very young age. She still beats her face every single day, like cannot leave the house without her makeup. But when she had me, she wanted me to resist the pressure that she was under, so I wasnât allowed to wear makeup until my senior year of high school. Thatâs a tough thing when youâre in it. [Laughs] I would put on mascara when I got to school in the morning, and then on the bus ride home, I would use wipes to take it off. At this point, Iâve learned what works for me and what I like, and so Iâve created a sort of uniform for myself. I keep it classic and then a little somethingâlike a darker lipâif Iâm going out.
SKINCARE
When I started building a routine, I felt like I had just been dropped off on Earth. Thereâs so much information out there, and it can be really contradictory, so I went to a Kiehlâs store for a skin consultation because I wanted someone to explain every product, step by step.
I donât wash my face in the mornings. Maybe Iâll splash some water on it, but after that, I just put Aquaphor on my face when I wake up. It makes my face feel and look like silk. Well, every once in a while, Iâll add in the Kiehl's Avocado Eye Creamâwhich is really good under makeupâand the Daily Reviving Concentrate Oil, but usually, itâs just Aquaphor. If Iâm going outside, Iâll put on sunscreen of course. I use the Super Fluid UV Defense Facial SPF. Itâs super light and a little tintedâbut not as pigmented as a tinted moisturizerâso it doesnât leave behind a white film. I love that it doesnât have a scent, too.

At night, I use the Ultra Facial Cleanser. Itâs a no-frills classic and gets the job done. If I have heavy makeup on, Iâll get it off first with the Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil. It really breaks everything down. Then I do a layer of the Cucumber Herbal Toner. The way they described toners to me is that cleansers are the equivalent of sweeping a floor but toners are the equivalent of mopping. I love this one because itâs alcohol-free. Then I pat on the Midnight Recovery Concentrate Face Oil. Itâs supposed to make you look more radiant.
If my skin is feeling really dry, Iâll use the Ultra Facial Overnight Face Mask. I love it because itâs clearâit looks like I'm just putting Aquaphor onâand I can easily rinse it off in the morning. My skin always feels so good after. I also love Sonsieâs Multi Moisture Mask. Itâs so easy to travel with.
Since weâre in New York and I donât know whatâs hitting my face when Iâm walking down the street, I always have Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay at home. But I probably only use it once a month because itâs very powerful and I donât want to dry out my skin even more. It really makes me feel like Iâm bringing out all of the pollution and yuckiness thatâs trapped in my pores.
My Mount Lai Jade Gua Sha broke so I need to get a new one, but we all want to highlight the things that we like about our face right? I like my cheekbones, but Iâm 36 years old, so I donât know how much longer I have with them. [Laughs] The gua sha helps me draw them out. Normallyâwhen itâs not brokenâI use it every other day for the length of three songs with one of my Kiehlâs face oils. Iâve tried it with Aquaphor and that was fine, but the face oils give me more of a slip to work with.

MAKEUP 
When it comes to makeup, a big priority for me is to make sure that itâs as natural as possible. I have pretty dark eye circles, so I like to use both Revlonâs ColorStay 5-in-1 Concealer in shade 002 Universal Brightener and Make Up For Everâs HD Skin Smooth & Blur Undetectable Under Eye Concealer in shade 2.5(N) Desert under my eyes. I apply a very thin layer. My mom has pretty dark eye circlesâand her mom did, tooâand Iâm trying to embrace those similarities in our family. Overall, Iâm in an era of embracing all parts of myself. I like that I can look in the mirror and see my grandmother and my mom.
Iâve really been loving Saieâs Dew Blush in Spicy and Rosy. These blushes feel like more of a tint to me, although theyâre very buildable if you want more pigment. Tower 28 has a great shade of their BeachPlease Cream Blush called Rush Hour, too. For a seamless look, sometimes I brush on a bit of the blush on my eyelids. But recently, Iâve been using Meritâs Solo Shadows, especially the Midcentury shade. They have a cream-to-powder formula that makes it easy for girls like me who don't necessarily know what theyâre doing when it comes to blending eyeshadow. [Laughs] I donât find Chanelâs Les 4 Ombres Multi-Effect Quadra Eyeshadow palettes intimidating either. I love the 266 TissÃ© Essentiel and 334 Modern Glamour versions. Tom Fordâs Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow Palette in De La CrÃ©me is great, too. I especially love that the palettes have four colors, so it takes the guesswork out of picking colors to combine.
I have thinner, lighter lashes, and Iâm trying to embrace that, but I do love Meritâs Clean Lash Mascara. I also donât pluck or wax my brows because theyâre already kind of thin. I recently found the e.l.f. Wow Brow Gel in Deep Brown at Target. Itâs easy and to the pointâand it doesnât add too much product.
On an average day, I stick to my Lucas Papaw Ointment for my lips, or Gucciâs Hydrating Lip Balm in Joslyn Clair is great if I want an elevated lip balm. For color, I really like Meritâs Tinted Lip Oil in Falcon and SangriaâSangria especially stains the lips for hours. My absolute go-to is Makeup by Marioâs MoistureGlow Plumping Lip Serum in Honey Glow. I have one in my errands bag and in my makeup bag; youâll never catch me without one. Every once in a while, I love a red lipstick like Armaniâs Lip Magnet Liquid Lipstick in Hollywood. Chanel has really good reds too. I feel like when I wear a Chanel redâI love the Rouge Allure Laque in InvincibleâIâm always like, âTake a photo of this please. I need everyone to see.â
HAIR
In college, I shaved the sides of my head. My hair was bleached red and black, too. Iâm so grateful that I was able to survive that era of my life. [Laughs] At this point, I think I have virgin hair again. I let it air dry as much as possible, but I do get a blowout every two weeks. I like big hairâIâll always have that little bit of Texas in me. I go to this little hole-in-the-wall in Chinatown that charges me like $24. The girls spend 10 minutes massaging you. Itâs amazing, but Iâm sorry, Iâm gatekeeping the name because itâs that incredible. Iâve been going there for five years now. And twice a year, I make a trip up to the Upper East Side to get my hair trimmed by Diana Barbaros at Kolor Bar. Since I'm short, I have to make sure that my hair doesn't also pull me down, so I try to make sure that the layers are higher up to kind of elongate my body.

I have a great relationship with the brand Ceremonia because it's founded by Babba Canales. I remember when this was just an idea, so to see it fully in Sephora is so special. I really like the ChampÃº de Yucca because itâs good for dry hairâand my hair is very dry. It smells incredible, too. Sometimes Iâll use the Guava Leave-In-Conditioner as a sort of mask. Iâll put it in for a few minutes and then rinse it out. Iâll use the Aceite de Moska before washing my hair every once in a while, too. Itâs a scalp oil thatâs meant to help with flakiness and frizz.
As far as post-washing and styling go, my absolute favorite Ceremonia products are the Pequi Curl Activator and the Style Refresher. I like to use the Pequi Curl Activator on the last four days before I wash it. Itâs great because it does activate your curls, but the serum doesnât harden or grease up your hair. Itâs not like a gel, where your hair automatically sets or starts to flake. After Iâve slept on my hair like this, I just spray the Refresher to reset my curls. Similarly, OUAIâs Wave Spray is really great. I use this a lot at the beach or after I get out of a pool if I want to keep my waves. OUAIâs Hair Oil is so good, too. You only need a tiny amount and it gets rid of your fly-aways.
NAILS 
Every two weeks, I go to Cobble Hill Nails & Spa for dip powder, which I love because I deal with hangers a lot and dip makes my nails so strong. I donât do anything to them in between appointments. If anything, I might use Aquaphor on my cuticles. I always go with red nails because the color goes with everything. Red stands the test of time between seasons and allows me to focus my creativity around styling my personal clients or curating looks for editorials.
FRAGRANCE
When it comes to fragrances, Iâm drawn towards woodsy, masculine, darker scents. I've always been that way. Similar to my style, I think of scent as a uniformâonce I find something that I like, I will not leave it.
I would drink Byredoâs Super Cedar in a cocktail glass if I could. It makes me feel really confident. In New York, weâre in such close quarters on the streets and in the restaurants, so we always smell the same scents, but I donât smell Super Cedar oftenâand I want to stand out. When I first moved to New York, I was wearing a different scentâyou can probably guess the oneâbut then everyone got it, and it was too much. When I found Super Cedar, it was a game-changer.
Growing up, the little southern girl in me always wanted to own a Chanel scent, and now I have Paris-Venise. I don't necessarily wear it often, but it's here as a reminder that I can do the things that I always wanted. Ceremoniaâs Perfume de la Tierra is really nice, too. It feels musky and reminds me of how it smells after it rains. I love the bottle; itâs so beautiful to style on your vanity.
In college, I wore Burberryâs classic eau de parfum. I donât wear it now, but I like to smell it so I keep a bottle around. [Laughs] It brings back so many good memories of the time before I came to New York.â

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:18:57,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/ask-dietitian-whats-deal-starvation-mode/,Why Severe Calorie Deficits Arenât Always Good For Weight Loss,1231,"Julian Selemin is a medical and ethnobotanicals writer with several years of experience in the industry. He has a BA in Languages and is currently majoring in Contemporary Music.
Stephanie Tarnacki, RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She received her Bachelors in Dietetics from University of Northern Colorado and completed her Dietetic Internship at Montana State University. Her experience extends from adult and neonatal intensive care, diabetes, kidney, weight management to school nutrition and menu compliance.
Our bodies are very smart when it comes to surviving under harsh conditions. A fantastic â and somewhat infamous example â is adaptive thermogenesis, more commonly known as âstarvation mode.â
But what is âstarvation modeâ and what role does it play in a weight loss journey?Â Hereâs what you need to know.
The concept of starvation mode is simple: If you donât eat enough, your body will believe youâre starving. In turn, your body may maintain some of your weight and fat as an attempt to preserve energy, making it harder for you to lose weight.
âStarvation modeâ only happens when a substantial caloric deficit is maintained for an extended period. While the exact timeline will vary depending on several factors, one study shows that it can happen after about a week of an extreme daily caloric restriction.
Thereâs just no getting around it. Your body needs calories to work correctly.
If you donât eat enough, your body will slip into âadaptive thermogenesis,â the scientific term for âstarvation mode.â This will slow your whole metabolism down, causing several side effects that will become more and more noticeable the longer you maintain the calorie deficit.
Hereâs a quick rundown of the most commonÂ âstarvation modeâ symptoms:
The exact symptoms may vary from person to person but are usually accompanied by a general decrease in your weight loss rate. If you start experiencing any of these side effects, contact a doctor or nutritionist as soon as possible.
When in âstarvation modeâ, your metabolic rate may decrease significantly, especially if youÂ lose too much weight too quickly. Metabolic rate refers to the number of calories you burn daily, making it crucial to the caloric intake and outtake formula.
The exact numbers will vary depending on how fast you lose body weight, but a good rule of thumb is thatÂ adaptive thermogenesis will kick in after about one week of severe caloric restriction, which is restricting total daily energy intake to be below basal metabolic rate (BMR).
BMR is the amount of energy in calories your body needs just to do the basicsâbreathing, circulating blood, regulating body temperature, and repairing cellsâwhen at rest. Think of it as the calories youâd burn if you stayed in bed all day. Itâs affected by things like your age, sex, weight, height, body composition, and even genes.
And, according to registered dietitian and scientific advisory Scott Keatley, 1,200 calories is the absolute bare minimum a human body needs daily. (Aka, the lowest BMR you can have). âEven someone under 5 feet and 100 pounds needs more if they do anything beyond blink,â he says.
No, intermittent fasting is different from âstarvation mode.â
First, fasting is only done for a predetermined amount of time, preventing you from going into adaptive thermogenesis.
To put it simply, fasting is a controlled, short-term caloric deficit, while starvation mode is an automatic mechanism that kicks in during long-term, low-calorie diets.
Intermittent fasting can be beneficial to some, providingÂ several health benefits, such as reducing oxidative stress and boosting brain function. Starvation mode, on the other hand, is a sign of damage to your body due to an extended caloric deficit. Remember, consult with your physician before starting any new diet regime, including intermittent fasting, to ensure it is right for you.
There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that intermittent fasting has helped people lose weight alongside a healthy, whole food diet.
The first â and maybe most frustrating â side effect of low-calorie diets is that âstarvation modeâ can cause your weight loss rate to stall. This can quickly become a catch-22: You eat less because youâre not losing weight, andÂ you donât lose weight because youâre not eating enough.
Over time, starvation can also cause yourÂ muscle mass to decrease due to the overall reduction of calories, weight, and energy. Similarly, your overall body temperature will drop.
A body in âstarvation modeâ for extended periods is also more vulnerable to illnesses and wounds. The risk of anxiety, irritability, and depression also rises, and you may even develop feelings of guilt and shame surrounding food.
Here are some otherÂ long-term âstarvation modeâ side effects:
If you think you may be in starvation mode, we suggest you notify your doctor right away.
Letâs face it â losing weight can be challenging. A desperation to lose weight quickly can lead to decisions that may work in the short term but are harmful in the long run.
You should avoid an aggressive approach to weight loss at all costs, as it will often lead you to patterns like yo-yo dieting. Instead, we think the best approach to weight loss isÂ adopting healthy nutritional and lifestyle decisions you can maintain long-term.
This includes exercise, one of the main pillars of weight loss. Moderate exercise canÂ greatly contribute to your losing weight while also keeping your body and mind healthy and active. But even light exercise can help!
You may also want to consider your current eating habits. Do you often find yourself snacking away through the night? Do you eat more when youâre anxious and stressed? Taking note of these habits can help you find common pitfalls in your diet and avoid unnecessary weight gain.
We recommend you keep a food diary to identify any possible patterns. If youâre not too keen on using pen and paper, MyFitnessPal features an extensive food diary with many features to help you start correcting your eating habits ASAP!
If you lose too much weight too quickly, your metabolic rate will decrease, making your weight loss journey much more difficult.
Thatâs why itâs crucial to follow a healthy weight loss plan that maintains (or even increases) your metabolic rate through exercise and a well-balanced diet. With several useful tools â such as a calorie tracker and food diary â the MyFitnessPal app is the perfect companion for all your weight loss efforts!

A Brief History of Automatons That Were Actually People
When human labor is hidden under the veneer of a robot or AI tool, thatâs âfauxtomationâ
By Brian Contreras

If youâve ever asked a chatbot a question and received nonsensical gibberish in reply, you already know that âartificial intelligenceâ isnât always very intelligent.
And sometimes it isnât all that artificial either. Thatâs one of the lessons from Amazonâs recent decision to dial back its much-ballyhooed âJust Walk Outâ shopping technology, a seemingly science-fiction-esque software that actually functioned, in no small part, thanks to behind-the-scenes human labor.
This phenomenon is nicknamed âfauxtomationâ because it âhides the human work and also falsely inflates the value of the âautomatedâ solution,â says Irina Raicu, director of the Internet Ethics program at Santa Clara Universityâs Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.

Take Just Walk Out: It promises a seamless retail experience in which customers at Amazon Fresh groceries or third-party stores can grab items from the shelf, get billed automatically and leave without ever needing to check out. But Amazon at one point had more than 1,000 workers in India who trained the Just Walk Out AI modelâand manually reviewed some of its salesâaccording to an article published last year on the Information, a technology business website.
An anonymous source whoâd worked on the Just Walk Out technology told the outlet that as many as 700 human reviews were needed for every 1,000 customer transactions. Amazon has disputed the Informationâs characterization of its process. A company representative told Scientific American that while Amazon âcanât disclose numbers,â Just Walk Out has âfar fewerâ workers annotating shopping data than has been reported. In an April 17 blog post, Dilip Kumar, vice president of Amazon Web Services applications, wrote that âthis is no different than any other AI system that places a high value on accuracy, where human reviewers are common.â
News of this technologyâs retirement in U.S. Amazon Fresh storesâin favor of shopping carts that let customers scan items as they shopâhas triggered renewed focus on an uncomfortable truth about Silicon Valley hype. Technologies heralded as automating away dull or dangerous work may still need humans in the loop, or as one Bloomberg columnist put it, AI software âoften requires armies of human babysitters.â
Itâs hardly a new phenomenon. Throughout history, canny inventors and entrepreneurs have sought to slap the âautomatedâ label on what was really just normal human activity. Take the âMechanical Turk,â a robe-clad robot that inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen debuted in the early 1770s. Von Kempelen would tell observers that the humanoid machine could play full games of chess, opening up the automaton to show off clockwork mechanisms within, as Atlas Obscura recounted.
But the Mechanical Turk was a sham. As many contemporary observers began to suspect, a human operator was hiding in a chamber beneath the chessboard and controlling its movements by candlelight. The clockwork mechanisms were simply window dressing for an easily impressed audience.

Itâs perhaps fitting that Amazon now runs a platform with the same name that lets companies crowdsource piecemeal online tasks that require human judgment, such as labeling the training data that modern AI systems learn from. After all, charades in the style of the original Mechanical Turkânominally automated systems that actually rely on human help, or what Jeff Bezos once dubbed âartificial artificial intelligenceââare common features of the modern Web, where an aura of technological sophistication can sometimes be more important than technological sophistication itself.
âThe idea of bringing something inanimate to life is an old and seemingly very human yearning,â says David Gunkel, a professor of media studies at Northern Illinois University and author of The Machine Question: Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots and Ethics. Pointing to tales as varied as Mary Shelleyâs 1818 novel Frankenstein and the 2014 film Ex Machina, he adds, âIt is in these stories and scenarios that we play the role of God by creating new life out of inanimate matter. And it appears that the desire to actualize this outcome is so persistent and inescapable [that] we are willing to cheat and deceive ourselves in order to make it a reality.â
Even before products such as ChatGPT and DALL-E kicked off the current artificial intelligence boom, this dynamic played out with less ambitious AI products. Consider X.ai, a company that once touted an automated personal assistant that could schedule meetings and send out e-mails. It turned out that the reason X.aiâs software seemed so lifelike was that it was literally alive, which Bloomberg reported in 2016: behind the scenes, human trainers were reviewing almost all inbound e-mails. Other concierge and personal assistant programs from that era were similarly human-dependent, and Bloombergâs report noted that the draw of venture capital may have incentivized start-ups to frame ordinary workflows as cutting-edge.
Itâs a dynamic that plays out across our increasingly online life. That food delivery robot carting a salad to your front door might actually be a young video game enthusiast piloting it from afar. You might think a social media algorithm is sifting out pornography from cat memes, when in reality human moderators in an office somewhere are making the toughest calls.
âThis is not just a question of marketing appeal,â Raicu says. âItâs also a reflection of the current push to bring things to market before they actually work as intended or advertised. Some companies seem to view the âhumans inside the machineâ as an interim step while the automation solution improves.â
In recent months the hype around generative AI has created exciting new opportunities for people to mask workaday human labor under a shiny, PR-friendly veneer of fauxtomation. Earlier this year, for instance, the Internet erupted in a furor over a posthumous George Carlin stand-up special that had purportedly simulated the late comicâs sense of humor with a machine-learning program trained on his oeuvre. But later, under the threat of a lawsuit from Carlinâs estate, one of the videoâs creators admitted through a spokesperson that the supposedly AI-generated jokes had in fact been written by an ordinary person.
It was the latest in a centuries-old tradition that continues to enchant and ensnare unwary consumers: humans pretending to be machines pretending to be humans once again.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:04,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/hannah-baxter-anxiety-beer-beauty-routine/,"Part II: Hannah Baxter, Beauty Editor",3138,"More Hannah! In Part I of the beauty editorâs Top Shelf, she walked ITG through her career path and over-the-top skincare routine. Now sheâs on to makeup, hair, nails, and fragrance. Get comfy! Itâs going to be a long, but very good ride.
MAKEUP
I donât really wear foundation and concealer that often, but when I do, I really like Glossierâs Stretch Balm Concealer. Itâs very lightweight and easy to sheer out, and it works well for under the eyes and doesnât settle into creases. I use shade Light 2. Iâve also seen so many makeup artists use the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, so when I think of concealer, thatâs what comes to mind. Itâs the OG. I use shade Light 2.5. When I want a more full-coverage option, I grab the Kulfi Hydrating Concealer. It perfectly covers any breakouts and smooths everything out. Itâs creamy without being greasy, which is hard to accomplish.
A few years ago I brought ILIAâs Super Serum Skin Tint to a friendâs wedding on a cruise ship, even though Iâd never used it before. I remember putting it on in the really horribly-lit ship bathroom, and it looked fucking amazing. Itâs so easy to apply and doesnât require a technique whatsoever. I use shade Formosa. If I have a big patch of melasma, I use Westman Atelierâs Vital Skin Foundation Stick in Atelier 0.5. It took me a while to figure out how to use it, but itâs a really nice formula thatâs buildable and doesnât settle into fine lines. And while I love to be super shiny, sometimes I need to tone it down. Tatchaâs Silk Setting Powder is great, but I recently discovered Wareâs PoreBoy. Itâs a stick formula that tampens down the shine. Itâs so easy to use.
Blush is my favorite makeup product of all time. I like putting a little bit on my forehead, so it looks like Iâm sunburnt without actually being sunburnt. I have every color of the Westman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick and I just rotate them based on how sallow my skin is looking. Meritâs Flush Balm Cream Blush is also nice to apply. I especially like Mood, a really dark burgundy color that gives you this post-sex sort of flush. ClÃ© de Peau BeautÃ©âs Cream Blush in Joyful Pink is another blush pot and lasts a really long time. The only powder blush that I have is Diorâs Rosy Glow in Coral, which is low-key a favorite color to wear of mine. It looks bright orange in the palette, but itâs flawless and looks great in the summer.

I love bronzer because I love being tan. The Chanel Les Beige Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream in 390 Soleil Tan Bronze? I use that shit everywhere. It looks really natural and the pot lasts such a long time, too. I do a little bit of contouring on my cheeks with the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. The position of our contour changes with every trend cycle, so Iâm still trying to figure it out, but I have good cheekbones and Iâm just trying to make them pop a little bit.
In middle school, I was emo to the core, so my eyeliner look very much was like a racoonâs. Now I only line my upper waterline. Lisa Eldridgeâs Seamless Glide Eye Pencil is so pigmented. Itâs like a Sharpieâbut safe. And the Victoria Beckham Satin Kajal Liner? Letâs be honestâPosh made a good liner. I like it in Navy Noir. When I was bartending full time at Webster Hall, I would go in with a full cat-eye, so Iâm pretty decent at getting liquid liner on me. The Danessa Myricks Beauty Linework Paintbrush Fluid Eyeliner is excellent. It has a thin tip and goes on super black.
I didnât use an eye primer for a long time, but I saw the error of my ways when my shadow started to crease. Urban Decayâs Primer Potion is my go-to. If Iâm going for a âfancierâ makeup look, I swear by Urban Decayâs 24/7 Eyeshadow Stick in Freak, an acid green that I like to apply around the inner corner of my eye to halfway down my lids. I have hazel eyes, so it brings out the green. It also takes two seconds. The Pat McGrath Labs Mothership V Palette also has an iridescent green shadow that I wear. Iâm almost out of it, and Iâm so bummed that you canât buy her shades in singles. I donât know what it is about green, but it makes me feel interesting and confident. Iâm a real believer that makeup is supposed to be fucking fun. While I love sculpting my cheekbones, I also want put on some fucking glitter. I want color. I want fun. I want silliness.
Joey Healy shapes and tints my brows every six months or so. I do like a bushy brow look, and I like Joeyâs Brow Structure Clear set to keep them brushed up. I think that the Kimiko Super Fine Eyebrow Pencil Automatique is a sleeper hit in the brow industry. Danielle Kimiko Vincent, the founder, does Sandra Ohâs brows, and she is so talented. The pencil only comes in one shade, a sort of gray, but itâs super fine. You can draw individual hairs very well. The KS&Co Tinted Brow Gel is also a dream. It doesnât deposit too much color, but it thickens up the hairs.
I have blonde eyelashes, so I need to darken them. Armaniâs Eyes to Kill Classico is my little black dress of mascara. It lengthens. It gives you Bambi eyes. I like it so much that I didnât want to like Gucciâs Mascara LâObscur, but it nails it every single time. It pains me to say it, but itâs worth the money. The same goes for Victoria Beckham Beautyâs Future Lash Mascara. When it comes to âcleanâ options, getting rid of all of the nasties in mascaras has come so far. I bounce back and forth between Tower 28 MakeWaves and Saieâs Mascara 101.

I feel the most myself with a lip. I hate to be such a cliche, but it feels very French to me to just have a bold lip with a bare face. HermÃ¨sâs lipstick in Orange Boite is a sheer-ish orange-red. It looks crazy in the bulletâlike a carrotâbut itâs perfect. Rouge Casaque is my bad bitch red. If I need to close a deal, thatâs the one Iâm wearing. Meanwhile, Byredoâs lipstick in Divorce is my sexy red. I love the whole Chanel Rouge Coco Baume lineâthe balms are super moisturizing. Dream is my flawless color. Itâs a perfect burnt rosyâlike your lips but better. Meritâs Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil also has a beautiful formula.
I discovered Sunnies Face when I was in Korea shopping in Myeongdong. Their Lip Treat in Girl Crush, a warm rose, and Poppy, a reddish orange, are perfect. They have a lovely consistency. I have every single color from Sisleyâs Lipstick Phyto-Rouge Shine lineâtheyâre fucking flawlessâbut I especially love Sheer Blossom, Sheer Petal, and Sheer Ginger. For balms, they stay on so long. Every woman in my family uses the Burtâs Bees Tinted Lip Balm in Rose. I have one in every bag I own, and theyâre only $5. Chanelâs NÂ°1 de Chanel Lip and Cheek Balm helps me look not dead, and I also have the Zelens Lip Enhancer. Itâs one of those balms that adjusts to the pH of your lips. Remember when Smashbox had the O-Gloss? Itâs like that but a little bit fancier.
HAIR
My mom went gray extremely early. My entire life I only knew her with silver hair, which is amazing because it reminds me that going gray is not the worst thing in the world. The pandemic really sparked me going gray very rapidly though. I had one or two grays that I could pluck up until that point, and now, I have a full on silver streakâI call it my power streak. Iâve been going to Colleen Flaherty for my blonde for the past five or six years. I see her every four months or so, and weâre slowly starting to let my gray come through a little bit more because thereâs no stopping it.
When I had a bobâI had one for five yearsâI went to Erickson A at Bumble and Bumble. I love him because heâs great at working with textured hair. Lately though, Dhiran Mistry has been my go-to. My hair grows out really well anytime I go to him.
Iâve been going to the Harklinikken Clinic because I lost a lot of hair last year. I was having a really stressful summer, and I was losing a Pomeranianâs worth of hair every time I showered. Then, of course, losing your hair makes you more stressed and your cortisol levels rise and it becomes a vicious cycle. I use Harklinikkenâs serum when my hair is 90 percent dry. I also use their Stabilizing Scalp Shampoo and Daily Hair Conditioner, which is sort of a bummer because I want to test a bunch of stuff, but I do feel like theyâre working. My hairâs starting to grow back, especially around my temples. That said, Iâm generally not loyal to a lot of shampoo and conditioners. I love the Crown Affair Ritual Shampoo and Conditioner. The conditioner in particular is so creamy.

I love how accessible Odele is as a whole. Their Clarifying Shampoo is so good. The Oribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Shampoo and Conditioner are really great for blondes in particular. I also use the Olaplex No.4P Blonde Enhancer Toning Shampoo once a week because my hair tends to get brassy really quickly. Plus, my dadâs a redhead, so I have some red undertones and I donât like that. And because I live in New York and the water is hard, I have the Canopy Filtered Showerhead, which I feel like helps keep my blonde really bright.
Because I have textured and colored hair, it can get really dry, so I always use Crown Affairâs Leave-In-Conditioner or Living Proofâs Restore Repair Leave-In when I get out of the shower. The process goes: I get out of the shower, add a leave-in, put in some JVN Complete Air Dry Cream, which helps with frizz, and Ceremonia Pequi Curl Activator. Itâs my holy grail curl product. I have really fine 2A-2B waves, and everything that Iâd come across for curls up until that point was too creamy and weighed down my hair. The Activator is a sort of gel-serum hybrid. Honestly, I love everything from Ceremonia. Babba Canales, the founder, did such a beautiful job catering to people with curlier hair. I use the Guava Rescue Spray for heat protection, too. And then I use the RÅz Santa Lucia Styling Oil on my ends.
Iâm really lazy with hair masks, but theyâre nice to have as an extra treat. Odeleâs Moisture Mask is a favorite. It took me a long time to get on the K18 Leave-in Molecular Repair Hair Mask train because you canât use conditioner with it and that feels like sacrilege for textured hair, but I do feel like it helps with split ends and preventing breakage since Iâm bleaching it all the time. I use it once a month.
I feel very elegant and put together when I have a snatched, Bella Hadid bun, even though it is really bad for your hair. But because I have rogue baby hairs from all of the regrowth, I have a lot of frizz. I swear by the Mielle Organics Honey & Ginger Edge Gel. That shit will shellac your hair down. Just use an old toothbrush, and it fucking works. It can be windy, it can be raining, and your hairâs not going anywhere. You do have to shampoo really hard to get it out though.
I only properly brush my hair before I get in the shower. Cim Mahony gave me a Mason Pearson pocket brush when I was in Copenhagen. Actually, thatâs a funny story. I went on a press trip to Stockholm, and then I flew from Stockholm to Copenhagen for eight hours just to get my hair dyed. It was probably the best blonde Iâve ever had in my life. Now I'm obsessed with this new French brand, La Bonne Brosse, for a very chic alternative to the Mason Pearson.âI use the No. 2 brush. On my wet hair, I use Crown Affairâs Comb No. 002 to brush my leave-in through.
Iâm a big proponent of air drying, but itâs not always feasible. Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer with the diffuser attachment works the fastest. It minimizes the frizz. And the Amika High Tide Beach Waver Curling Iron is my secret weapon for getting my wavesâit lifts up the roots and itâs easy to use. I rarely enjoy getting my hair blown out because it looks too precious, but Mark Towsend always gives me a great blow out. He does Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsenâs hair, so he just gets it. If I flat iron my hair, which is very rare these days, I use the T3 Smooth ID Smart Flat Iron.

NAILS
Getting my nails done is one of my favorite affordable luxuries. I live around the corner from a cute nail salon, Elements Beauty Lounge, which was always a goal for me in New York. For a fancier manicure, Iâm the biggest fan of JinSoon. Itâs so calming.
I like doing my own manicuresânot pedicuresâand I got really good during the pandemic. Generally, I like a shorter, oval-shaped nail. When theyâre too long, itâs too hard to type. I love the Chanel nail file to shape them. The Bare Hands Dry Gloss Manicure Kit is perfect, too. It comes with a glass file and cuticle oil.
In terms of colors, I love JinSoonâs Palma. Itâs an electric Kelly green. JinSoonâs Cool Blue is an Yves Klein blue. Actually, I really like getting ugly colors on my nails. JinSoonâs Charme looks disgustingâkind of like baby vomitâbut in a fashionable way. Itâs like an electric yellow, slimy green, and I really, really love it. Chanelâs 953 Essentiel [discontinued] is like a toffee brown. And every time I get Essieâs Yes, I Canyon, I feel flawless. Itâs the perfect orange-red.
FRAGRANCE
I switch up my scent depending on the season, my mood, and the time of dayâwhat I wear in the morning is not necessarily what I'm going to wear at night. I gravitate towards woody scents. I love amber, salt, and rose. I think rose gets a bad rap as being an old lady scentâit can be really sexy when done right. In the summer, I love Ellis Brooklynâs SALT. It smells like the seaside, like if youâve just been outside playing by the beach. And it gets better when you sweat into it. Fueguia 1833 is a recent find of mine. All of the brandâs scents are beautiful, but Cactus Azul is a very sharp but earthy scent. Itâs clean and dry and smells better the longer you wear it. Actually, it reminds me of what a post-sex smell would beâin a nice wayâlike just something from inside your body. I really love the ethos behind D.S. & Durgaâs Bistro Waters. It has green pepper, mandarin, moss water, and nutmeg. Itâs savory and complex.
L'Eau Papier is one of Diptyqueâs newer scents. People always ask me about it when I wear it. You wouldn't think that a page of a book would inspire a very attractive scent because, I think, youâd either love or hate that. But itâs very fresh and bright and lighter than you would expect.
I wrote a story diving deep into how smells and aromacology can actually affect your mood, so I love the idea of a functional fragrance. Mind Energy from The Nue Co. is really uplifting. I wear it a lot when I have a big day of events. Does it actually give me more energy? I don't know, but it appeals to something in me and I know that I should have more energy by wearing it, so I feel better.

Lover by The Maker is the perfume that gets me the most comments. Itâs just really cozy and delicious in a way that makes you want to smell it again. It makes you want to be in a dark hotel amongst velvet with soft candle lighting. Kriglerâs Boudoir Renaissance 223 is really well-balanced. Itâs somewhat floral but earthy. Itâs rich but not too musky. Itâs sort of slinky. Itâs another good date night perfume. Itâs a mouthwatering one.
Iâm a fucking candle freak. I know that they're not the best for you, but you pick your battles. I mean, I inject botulinum toxin into my face on a regular basis, so yeah, Iâm going to light a candle. I canât even tell you what Netteâs Safari really smells likeâI mean the notes are suede, violet leaves, and mossâbut itâs just so good. And again, I love rose, and thereâs something very elegant about Diptyqueâs Roses. I also love Baies. Thatâs the classic one.
I love Matthew Herman and David Kien, the boys behind Boy Smells. I remember writing about them when they launched their Kush candle. It was one of my first big beauty profiles that I did, so they're very near and dear to my heart. I now really love the Spirituous candle, the votive especially. I like that it's lit up by the flame.
Iâve gone through a lot of Byredo Woods candles. I grew up on a farm and having any sort of land around me makes me feel very humble, and I love carrying that feeling through a candle. The same goes for D.S. & Durgaâs Big Sur After Rain. I have the hand soap of it, too.
It's always a conversation piece to have a cannabis candle in your home. I'm a cannabis user, and you can elevate that shit and make it into a candle. Itâs earthy and blends well with the smells of a home. I love Malin + Goetzâs.â

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:19:03,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/all-about-alternatives-milk/,All About Alternatives: Milk,774,"The milk aisle definitely isnât what it used to be, even 10 years ago. With plant-based diets increasing in popularity, more individuals are switching things up from regular cowâs milk to trying milk derived from plants like almonds, coconut, peas, cashews, and oats (to name a few). There seems to be a new kind of plant milk popping up every couple of months, vying for the title âbest new alt milk.â But how do these âaltâ milks stack up nutrition-wise? Letâs take a look.

Almond milk may be one of the âOGâ alt milks, but it has had some strong staying power against some of the newer plant milks. I think this is partly because of its simple, mild flavor that works in anything from a latte to a bowl of cereal, and partly because of its nutrition profile. Depending on the brand and flavor, some almond milk differs slightly in nutrient content. In general, almond milk is relatively low in most nutrients, including protein, fat, carbohydrates and calories. It is not a good source of most vitamins and minerals, but many almond milk brands are fortified with vitamin D, B12 and calcium.

Pea milk is one of the newer alt milks, and it differentiates itself from some of the others because itâs a good source of plant-based protein. At about 8 grams per cup, pea milk is comparable to cowâs milk and soy milk in the protein department, and may be a good option if that macro is important to you. Protein helps promote satiety and satisfaction after meals, and this makes pea milk a good option for things like smoothies and protein shakes. It has a mild flavor so is fairly versatile and can even be used in baking. Like almond milk, fortified versions of pea milk contain vitamin D, calcium, B12 and potassium.

Maybe the newest alt milk, oat milk is, you guessed it, made from oats. Since oats themselves are packed with nutrition, especially heart-healthy soluble fiber, one would hope at least some of that transfers over to oat milk. And it does, to a point. One cup of oat milk contains about 1 gram of soluble fiber, and more protein compared to almond milk (about 3 grams per cup). Since itâs made from a carbohydrate (oats), oat milk contains more carbs compared to some other alt milks, with about 16 grams per cup. The nutrient density here helps make oat milk a hearty, filling choice. Itâs great on the side of fruit or a piece of toast for a snack, or in your favorite espresso beverage.

Coconut milk (not the stuff in the can, but the kind you buy in the alt milk aisle), can add delicious flavor to coffee beverages, yogurts or on its own with a cookie. It does differ the most nutritionally from the other examples listed above, however. Coconut milk is the only alt milk here with fat primarily made up of saturated fat, which is usually found in animal products but is also the primary fat in coconuts. Saturated fat can contribute to elevated LDL cholesterol levels, and I do recommend limiting it or replacing it with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats when possible. Coconut milk also contains no protein, so thatâs something to keep in mind if you want your alt milk to be a protein source. Coconut milk is fairly low in vitamins and minerals, but many brands are fortified with vitamin D, calcium, vitamin A and B12.
Alt milk is a great place to explore if youâre trying to include more plant-based foods in your diet. While they differ in some ways nutritionally, no one is âbetterâ than the other. Choose your alt milk for flavor, consistency and honestly, whichever one you like the best. Just make sure to read the nutrition label to be in the know about whether or not your milk is fortified with important vitamins like D, calcium and B12.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:50,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/tonya-papanikolov-rainbo-canada-fairy-wedding/,Inside An Ethereal âFairy FÃªteâ Wedding,1492,"After three years of hearing about one another from a mutual friend, Tonya Papanikolov met her now-husband Simon Chantry on a blind date in 2017. âHe was unlike anybody I had ever dated before, so there was this element of breaking a pattern for me.â says Papanikolov, the founder of medicinal mushroom company, Rainbo. âHe was living in Barbados at the time, and when he told me about his line of work, which was all in the cryptocurrency space, it was almost like he was talking in a different languageâbut he came across as so grounded. There was this beautiful ease, and that has spanned our whole relationship.â Six years later, under the new moon of the 2023 summer solstice, the couple got married on the same Canadian island where Simon proposed. Their friends served as the vendors for the coupleâs âfairy fÃªte,â which included a six-foot âforestâ cake, mushroom centerpieces, and a performance from the groom. Tonya tells us all about it below.
Dear ITG,
Our mutual best friend, Drummond, had been telling Simon and I about one another for three years, but we were both in relationships. Drum used to say, âYou two think the same. Youâre both out there in terms of your imagination and how kind you are.â My ears always perked up when I heard his name. I never pursued it, but I thought he sounded awesome. Then in 2017, I went through a big, big breakup. I had a few months to myself before I decided we should meet, which we eventually did, at a wine bar in Toronto called Archive.
Itâs funny because on the way to the bar, I remember thinking that I didnât even know what Simon looked like. I texted Drum, and he said, âWalk towards the man with the beautiful curly hair.â He had told Simon, âItâs the beautiful woman with the curly hair.â When I got there, sure enough, I knew exactly who to approach. After the bar, I took him to my friend Harrison Taylorâs art show. He and his wife, Amanda Laine, who are two of our closest friends, ended up officiating our wedding. There were lots of sweet little ties like this in our wedding, but before we get to thatâ¦
I was completely surprised when Simon proposed. Thereâs an island in Ontario called Prince Edward County where weâve had a lot of special moments together. It was where we professed our love to one another in 2018, and it was where we got engaged. I thought we were celebrating Simonâs birthday in March of 2021, so the proposal was a complete, complete surprise. We were taking a walk down a pier, and he accidentally hit me across the face with his elbow, so I had all these tears streaming down my face. I think he was nervous, so he just hopped down on one knee and asked. My one eye was tearing uncontrollably, but I was just so happy. It was also a new moon, which he didnât realize at the time, and these kind of celestial events are important to me. We later decided to get married at The Bright House on the island.
Honestly, we didnât really start planning until quite a while after our engagement. I started a Pinterest board with inspiration, and the initial board was called âFairy FÃªte.â It was very celestial, with photos of fairies and mushrooms and moss and angels. At a certain point, I remember thinking, âAm I going to wear fairy wings to my wedding? How fun would that be?â The board is pretty far out there, but we did land somewhere in that realmâand still called it âFairy FÃªte.â
Everybody told us our wedding was âso usâ and that it was the most uncommon wedding that they had ever attended. Obviously, it was a wedding and we had some traditional aspects, but we really tried to make it our own and to celebrate everyone who played a big role in our love story. Harry and Amanda were at the altar with usâthey began the ceremony by leading everyone through a meditation and speaking to the planets that had come into alignment on that dayâand we brought Drum out on a leopard couch down the aisle to commemorate being the best man and introducing us. All of our vendors were our friends, too. The music was by Roxy Moon, and we also had a performance by Baby Baby, which is my dear friend Pandoraâs band. Even Simon performed. That was a big surprise.
Creating the floral and mushroom arrangementsâand the overall decorâwas a really fun process with one of my dear friends, Lauren Wilson from Timberlost. We found beautiful vintage Moroccan rugs, which we used for the ceremony, through Mellah in Toronto. I was so thrilled with the mushroom arrangements especiallyâtheyâre so beautiful and very much in line with the fairy theme. Even our 6-foot âforest cake,â which was actually a strawberry shortcake, had real mushrooms, fresh flowers, and some tree and plant shrubs on it. Natalie Korac made it, and on top of looking amazing, it really was the most delicious cake Iâve ever had. And actually, we have a Rainbo product called Forest Juice. Itâs maple syrup infused with mushrooms, so as a gift for everyone, we gave everyone a bottle. Simon and Iâs nickname for each other is âsweets.â Everybody calls us âThe Sweetsâ now, so we called the syrup Sweets Juice as a play on Forest Juice.
The savory food came from Emmaâs Eatery by Emma Moore. Iâve worked with her before, and you feel like youâre eating nourishing food thatâs made for a small group of people. Among the menu, we had salmon, steak, fingerling potatoes, and grilled vegetables. It was all gluten-free, dairy-free and cooked in olive oil, and it really did have the most delicious home-cooked meal feel.
My dress was a custom combination of two gowns from Newhite, and I had a celestial star veil from Ofrendaâit was the one piece that I knew I wanted when I got married. I wore a silk hairband from Aura Eire, star earrings from Jennifer Behr, and pearls from Chan Luu. Simon is a really big manâheâs like 6â4ââand he has a very particular style, so he designed his beautiful wool jacket and collared shirt himself. He wore a bolo tie with my face on it, which was hilarious.
For my beauty look, I just wanted to look very natural and dewy with a little bit of sparkle and shimmer. Romy Zack did both my makeup and hair and absolutely got it right. She used a lot of Saie products, including the Slip Tint, Glowy Super Gel, Glow Sculpt Blush, and Glossybounce Lip Oil in Kiss, to achieve the look.
I always wear sandalwood oil, so I did wear that, but in terms of my signature scent, itâs a secret. Itâs an obscure one that everybody would copy when I was younger, so at a certain point I decided to stop telling people.
I didnât do a whole lot of âprepâ ahead of the wedding. I did two microneedling appointments and a Pure Glow facial at Pure + Simple and a Forma treatment at Tight Clinic, but what I really wanted to focus on was more so for a radiant body in terms of my own energy. I already practice a lot of Kundalini yoga, but Simon and I did a five-class rebirthing workshop. Weâre both such busy entrepreneurs, and we wanted to move into the next phase of our relationship as consciously as possible, to take a moment to slow down and digest what this meant for our relationship and the vows that we were saying to one another, and to put an end to any of the old programming from the past.
Overall, it was the most beautiful day. As we read our vows to each other, our guests had their jaws open because the sun started shining, the wind stopped, and even the birds began chirping. There were all of these beautiful little things that happened in the moments of speaking our vows. It was like time kind of stood still in this instant of saying these profound words to one anotherâand thatâs a moment that really stays with me.

Is ITG obsessed with cherries? Kind of. It started back in December at our holiday shoot. Studios are not the most, um, glamorous of places, so someone (probably Daise) had the bright idea to burn one of the candles in our gift guide early on. It was Sidiaâs Pyro candle, and while we already knew it smelled good (thatâs why we were shooting it!), we had no idea weâd become Pyro-crazed. Itâs all we talked about all day! (Mid-morning: âOh my God, your perfume is amazing, what is it?â âItâs the candle!â Coffee break: âMmmm, smells like cherry candy.â One hour before wrapping: âCan you move the candle closer to me?) By the time the shoot was over, another one was planned: We needed to celebrate all things cherry.
Valentineâs Day is the perfect holiday to double down on a cherry obsession. If youâre celebrating with someone, a sexy, smooth cherry perfume is the on-the-nose complement to what can be an unwieldy saccharine day. On the other hand, if youâre alone, a cherry manicure is perfect eye candy. And then there are the lipsâso many cherry lips. Scroll down to see what we mean.

You know that smoky and sweet scent your hair takes on after a post dinner drag? Of course you donât! Youâve never even seen a cigarette, and your post dinner anything always starts and stops with sleep. But if you could use your imagination, and think up the perfect marriage between a naughty [Posh voice] waft of tobacco and leather as it meets an undercurrent of black cherry, then youâve arrived at Victoria Beckham Beautyâs Suite 302 Eau de Parfum. Inspired by Victoria Beckhamâs whirlwind anniversary trip to Paris with David Beckham, itâs warm and spicyâpractically begging to be worn in a dimly-lit bar late at night. For the day, thereâs Tom Fordâs Electric Cherry Eau de Parfum. Itâs light and freshâthe tartness of morello cherries is offset by ginger and jasmine. Of course, not everything needs to smell like cherries! So in that case, consider these cute cherry beeswax candles from Happy Organics that smell of honey. Theyâre made using molds cast from actual cherries and are generally adorable.
Look, this is a cherry storyâof course thereâs going to be a bunch of lip products. In our opinionâand in the absence of Balm Dotcom Cherry (RIP)âthe perfect cherry lip wardrobe starts off with Fentyâs Ultra-Hydrating Lip Balm, the Barbados cherry-powered balm that Rihanna made in collaboration with A$AP Rocky. For a tinted option, thereâs U Beautyâs Plasma Lip in Shanghai. Itâs hydrating. Itâs vibrant. It plumps a little. And speaking of accentuating things, Kjaer Weisâs Lip Pencil in Faded, a slightly muted red, is a must-buy. Itâs a red thatâs not overwhelming. Itâs also the perfect companion to Violette_FRâs Petal Bouche in Cerise DÃ©sir, a matte liquid lip that doesnât transfer, so you can eat in peace and without touch-ups.
Sometimes you need a lipstick thatâs more of an objet, which is where Westman Atelierâs Les Rouges Lip Suede Lipstick Palette comes into play. Use your pinky to create a blurred, just-kissed lip. It has a matte finish, too, but because itâs made with cold-pressed cherry oil, you donât have to worry about your lips feeling dry. Plus, you can mix-and-match the four colors to create your perfect shade. But, if you want to keep it simple, go with a classic bullet via La Bouche Rougeâs Lipstick in Cherry Pink. And make it a monochromatic look with Tata Harperâs Cream Blush in Naughty. Pat it on and build it up as much as you want. Easy, peasy.
The best thing about a cherry manicure is that itâs never out of style. Donât believe us? Then look no further than last weekâs Top Shelf, where Rebecca Alanizâa stylist for crying out loudâtold us how her go-to polish of choice was a red one because it âgoes with everything.â So on that note, Gucciâs Goldie Red lacquer is a juicy cherry thatâs too glossy to pass up. Actually, so is La Bonne Brosseâs No. 2 Essential Brush. The shiny finish on the nylon and boar bristle brush gives ye olde Mason Pearson a run for its money in the âRolls Royce of hairbrushesâ category. Might we suggest giving it a whirl before cinching your hair in a cherry claw clip? Just when you think that little accessory is dunzo, it comes back with a cute upgrade. Right now the best are from Emi Jay, which hit the sweet spot in being not-too-small and not-too-big. But itâs the cherries that really make them worth your while.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:54,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/hannah-baxter-beauty-editor-career-skincare/,"Hannah Baxter, Beauty Editor",3321,"Once in a blue moon, ITG encounters a Top Shelf so rich that just one Top Shelf wonât do. Hannahâs decade-long beauty career puts her in this rare category. So today, read up on her career path and detail-oriented skincare routine. Tomorrow, sheâs getting into makeupâand everything else.
âI grew up in St. Louis, MissouriâKarlie Kloss and Jon Hamm are our pride and joyâbut I always knew that New York was the goal. My great Aunt Ruth, whoâs my favorite person in the world and the most fabulous woman, lived here for over 70 years. She was married three times. She traveled the world. She booked talent for cruise ships. She used to buy weed from Dizzy Gillespie. I idolized her growing up. We would visit her every summer, so I knew that I would end up here and become a writer. I went to Mizzou, University of Missouri, and started off as a journalism major. I quickly realized it wasnât for me when I had a class where the professor said, âIf you want to do anything in creative writing, change your major now.â So I did, and I ended up studying English and theater with an emphasis in playwriting.
CAREER
I moved to New York in 2013 and split my time between bartending and theater development, which is asking the government for money for the arts. It was soul crushing, but I got to see a lot of theater for free. At a certain point, I started applying for a million jobs at CondÃ© Nast and Hearstâthereâs probably some cyberspace place with 5,000 resumes that I sent inâbut I wasnât making any headway. Then I applied for a fellowship with Bust magazine. I learned about it from reading Tina Feyâs biography, Bossypants, and how they assured her they would retouch her armpit stubble but nothing else, which I thought was really cool. I later became their digital editor and was there for a year and a half.
When I joined Coveteur, I was definitely more of a generalist covering a little bit of everything, but I was really attracted to what was happening in beauty at the time. This was around 2015. I was reading Into The Gloss and xoJaneâRIPâand really liked that they were publishing a different type of beauty coverage. When Katie Jayne Becker, my former boss and now one of my best friends, became the beauty director, she helped guide me and nurture my love of beauty. I stayed at Coveteur for five years before going to The Zoe Report, where I was the deputy beauty editor. I was there for almost two years, and it was such a wonderful experience.

Going freelance was a very big decision. Iâve spoken to some editor friends who did something similar, and we all agreed that thereâs this feeling that if you get off the ride, youâre never going to be able to get back on. So I sat with the idea of going freelance for a long time. It had nothing to do with the place that I worked or the people that I worked withâif anything, thatâs what kept me in that kind of role for as long as it did. I was just ready for something different and I also wanted to prioritize my mental health in a way that wasnât just a soundbite. So, after much soul-searching, and checking my bank account, I left TZR in October of 2022.
I launched my bi-monthly newsletter Anxiety Beer two years ago. The name came out of a joke from peak COVID when you couldnât go to a bar, obviously, and we were all drinking probably more than we should have. And Iâm a beer girl. I worked at a brewery in college and I would go up to the roof at 5 or 6 oâclock and say, âItâs anxiety beer time.â I wanted to do some writing that wasnât about beauty, and it was around the time that I started seeing a therapist. I was newly committed to prioritizing my mental health, and I wanted to be really open about it. The response has been amazing. Iâve had people reach out to me and say, âI didnât realize other people felt this way.â I have a sister publication called Beer Face, where I talk more about beauty, fashion, and style, but the crux of the newsletter is just wanting to have an open dialogue about mental health.
SKINCARE
Injectables
Iâm a huge proponent of transparency in beauty. I go to Dr. Dendy Engelman at Shafer Clinic for Botox. As I was coming up in the beauty industry, I received treatments from other providers just because the opportunity presented itself and I loved seeing peopleâs technique, but I trust Dr. Engelmanâs technique implicitly. When I sit in her chair, sheâs like, âThe usual stuff?â I want to be able to move my eyebrows, but otherwise, I like being fairly frozen. I get it between my brows and the glabellar lines, and I just started getting it around my crowâs feet.
I also get Botox in my masseter muscles because I grind my teeth. When I was a baby editor, I went to a breakfast with Dr. Barbara Sturmâwhoâs so sweet and lovely, but also very directâand she was like, âDarling, your jawâs insane. Your muscles are really overdeveloped.â I took it hard, but then I saw photos of myself where, yeah, my jaw had started to get really large. It mightâve been Dr. Amy Wechsler who first started injecting my masseters, but they started to go down after that. It completely changed my face. Actually, my dentist loves that I get it because heâs like, âIf you keep grinding your teeth, youâre going to have to get them all pulled.â

I started getting filler when I was 31. Everyoneâs cheeks start to flatten out with age, and I got to the point where I was looking at my face and knew something was changing, but I couldnât figure out what. I get filler at the top of my cheekbones, maybe a little bit closer to my temples, now. Dr. Engelman also puts a little bit of filler right at the edge of my jawline, and we just started doing a tiny, tiny bit in my smile linesâeveryoneâs face ages differently, and I just know thatâs going to be where Iâll see the most change over the next few years. I also get lip filler because my lips are a little bit uneven from side to side.
I see Dr. Macrene Alexiades about once a year to blast off my cherry angiomas. I also go to her for Pico Genesis to treat my melasma. Iâve definitely done stuff that hasnât worked out for me. Dr. Dara Liotta gave me a lip flip, but my teeth are already small and I thought I looked crazy when I smiled. She did a really good jobâI just didnât like the look of it. And you canât get rid of itâyou have to wait for it to wear off. Beauty editors sometimes have to take one for the team. [Laughs]
Facials
Facials are one of my favorite things, and Iâve been so fortunate to see so many incredibly talented people. I first met Crystal Green maybe a year and a half ago. She has magic hands. She also has the most calming demeanor of anyone Iâve ever met. Iâve been seeing Elizabeth Grace Hand, the founder of StÃ¤lle Studios, recently. Sheâs like a walking billboard for herself because her skin is incredibly glowy. She also does buccal massage, and sheâs really, really knowledgeable. Sofie Pavitt is another one. I met her years ago before she had her new studio or her own line, and she is the acne whisperer. She does the best extractions. Sheâs always the one that convinces me to do a peel, even though I hate peelsâI donât like the feeling and I think that weâre all over-exfoliating in general.
Cleansers
Cleansing has low-key become my favorite step. I love the ritual of it, and I get in there and do a knuckle massageâI think Aida Bicaj, another good facialist, was the one who taught me how to do it. I love the Epi.Logic True Calm Rosehip Gel Cleanser. The packaging is flawless and it foams up in the most beautiful way. I rarely get to the bottom of a product, and Iâve gone through two bottles. The texture of the U Beauty Mantle Skin Conditioning Wash is also absolutely fabulous. I use it when my skinâs particularly dry but still has some congestion.

Iâll double cleanse if Iâm wearing a lot of makeup. The Peach & Lily Ginger Melt Oil Cleanser is divine. It has the perfect amount of slip and grip, so youâre actually getting makeup off. Sometimes oil cleansers leave a film behind, but once you rinse this one off, itâs actually gone. The Eadem Dew Dream Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm is my absolute favorite. My skin actually feels more hydrated after I use it, which is rare for a cleanser. Bioderma Sensibio H2O is the OG makeup remover though. My eyes are really, really sensitive, so I canât use anything if it has any sort of fragrance, and this one really works for me. The Shiseido Facial Cotton is also low-key the best cotton in the game. Itâs silky, silky soft. Itâs really worth the investment.
The Tatcha Rice Wash Soft Cream Cleanser is my favorite type of exfoliator. Like I said, I donât really enjoy exfoliating, but this one has just the perfect amount of grittiness. It really feels like itâs getting rid of dead skin, but itâs not stripping. The Current State Salicylic Acid + Green Tea Exfoliating Cleanser is nice if Iâm getting a breakout. I like the combination of salicylic acid and green tea to calm everything down.
Toners + Essences
After I cleanse, I always use a moisturizing tonerâyour skin needs to be a little bit wet when youâre using a humectant afterwards, so that's how I set the stage. I like to switch them up. I got to go to Korea with Laneige when they were launching their Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer, and the clinicals are insane. Itâs like a liquid moisturizer. Iâm absolutely obsessed with it. I like Environâs Botanical Infused Moisturizing Toner at night. Environâs a brand I really, really love. Youâll spot it at every single dermatologistâs office.
If I am going to exfoliate, I will use an exfoliating toner. The Biologique Recherche Lotion P50 is the classic. I get a lot of bumpiness on my forehead, so once that starts to pop up, once or twice a week, Iâll grab the P50. I feel like I beat my face into submission at this point so the stinging doesnât really bother me. The Danucera D22 Tonic is a gentler version of P50. Itâs lovely. Getting a facial with Danuta Mieloch, whoâs the founder of Danucera and Rescue Spa, is a religious experience. She somehow gets you so snatched. And then I keep the Tata Harper Floral Essence in my living room so my boyfriend and I can spritz each other. Heâs becoming a full-fledged beauty boy.

Actives
I always use an antioxidant serum to protect my skin from free-radical damage because we live in New York City and itâs a gross, disgusting mess out there. I love Protocolâs Vitamin C Superserum. The issue with vitamin C is that itâs so unstable and the shelf life is short, so you have to use that shit or it will turn. Protocol formulates in a facility thatâs free of oxygen and light and also used by NASA, which is so cool. Iâve gone through five bottles of the Superserum. Itâs one of the best on the market. The SkinBetter+ Alto Defense Serum is pricey, but it makes a huge difference in fighting dark spots. Iâll use anything from SkinBetter+ honestly. They have clinicals for days. Recently, Iâve been using the Matter of Fact Brightening + Firming Serum. Iâm wary sometimes when a product has such a high percentage of vitamin Câthis one has 20 percentâbut it works and it comes in a bottle that protects it from light and oxygen. And Caudalieâs Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum is an alternative to vitamin C. I think itâs a sleeper hit from the brand. Itâs so brightening. Itâs usually what I use when my skinâs a bit irritated and I need to pare everything back.
Iâve been using prescription tretinoin since I was 25. I use it five nights a week. Lately, Iâve been using a custom mix from Agency that has tretinoin, niacinamide, and azelaic acid. Meanwhile, growth factors are all the rage right now. Anytime Iâm not using a retinol at night, Iâll use the SkinMedica TNS+ Advanced Serum or the Epi.logic Master Plan. Theyâre pricey, but I do feel like theyâre whipping your skin into shape. I think if youâre really concerned about signs of premature aging, investing in one of these as opposed to getting a million other things is a good idea. Youâre going to get a lot of bang for your buck.
At this point in my life, Iâm pretty lucky and donât get a lot of breakouts, but when I do, they come out with a vengeance. I love the Starface Acne Patchesâitâs genius to rebrand acne as something thatâs fun and cute. Otherwise, I like INNBeauty Projectâs Medicated Acne Serum. Itâs salicylic acid-based, and it helps my pimples go away quickly. Good old benzoyl peroxide from the drugstore does the trick, too. Honestly, Iâm more concerned about the hyperpigmentation after than the breakout itself. Mandelic acid is the AHA that everyone needs to know about. Itâs great for all skin tones and itâs really gentle. I used Sofie Pavittâs Mandelic Clearing Serum for two weeks after I had a really gnarly breakout on my cheek, and it got rid of the crazy mark it left.

Hydration
I always apply some sort of hydrating serum. The PCA Skin Hyaluronic Acid Boosting Serum and Alastin HA Immerse Serum are basically interchangeableâthey both prompt your body to produce more hyaluronic acid. I know that hyaluronic acid is everywhere right now and you can get a more affordable version, but I like a really science-backed brand for this step.
The Dr. Loretta Intense Replenishing Ceramide Serum is one of those âif you know, you knowâ serums. It feels like cashmere on your skin. Itâs actually an occlusive serum, and itâs my last step before I go in with a moisturizer. The Of Other Worlds Light Beams Barrier Treatment is chock-full of glycerin. When my skin is freaking out with inflammation and I donât know why, I pare back everything and just use this, and it makes my skin so happy. The Dieux Deliverance Trinity Serum is also so good for calming. I travel with it because it hydrates, it protects, and it calms everything down. And the EstÃ©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex is my old-lady serum, but Iâve gone through six bottles of it. I love using it at night and slathering on some moisturizer afterward.
I believe that if you want to save money on your routine, you donât have to invest in an expensive moisturizer. Like every other beauty girly, I am guilty of going to City Pharma in Paris, and they have Eucerinâs UreaRepair, which is the best moisturizer. Itâs simple, it doesnât pill, it leaves you with a nice glow, itâs light enough for the summer, and itâs thick enough for the winter. I came back to the US with eight bottles of it in my suitcase. In the summer, sometimes I switch over to Tata Harperâs Superkind Fortifying Moisturizer. Itâs really lightweight, fragrance-free, and makes you glow like a disco ball. If I want a really fancy night cream, I like Dr. Barbara Sturmâs Super Anti-Aging Night Cream.

I know that everyoneâs obsessed with slugging, and oh my God, the Futurewise Slug Balm is really good. I put it on religiously every night. Everyone should be locking their moisturizer in with an occlusive if you want to prevent moisture loss. And Iâm not really an oil girl, but I remember learning about the Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil years agoâwell before Chrissy Teigen posted about itâand itâs perfect.
Homeoplasmine is another French pharmacy staple. I keep one in my bag because my nose gets dry for reasons I still canât understand. Itâs great for the lips, too. And Dr. Danâs Cortibalm Lip Balm is the least sexy product I own, but I will ride for it until the day I die. It has a very small percentage of hydrocortisoneâand itâs only $5.
Masks
I definitely think we should be masking at home. Biologique Rechercheâs Masque Vivant is a cult favorite for a reason. It really deep cleans your skin, but it sort of smells like garbage juice. [Laughs] Orvedaâs Deep Clearing Mud Mask will suck everything out of your pores, too. That shit is crazy. And RenÃ©e Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel is another good one. RenÃ©e, the founder, is such a wealth of knowledge. Weâre also birthday twins.
SPF
You might as well throw away any anti-aging stuff youâre using if youâre not using SPF. I like mineral sunscreens because there are some studies that suggest they can help prevent melasma. The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 is sort of the industry standard. It rubs in well, and it doesnât sting your eyes. Summer Fridays really nailed the formula of their ShadeDrops SPF 30 Mineral Milk Sunscreen. I did not think I was going to like it for reasons I donât really understand, but again, it blends in seamlessly. The same goes for Colorescienceâs SPF 50 Total Protection No-Show Mineral SunscreenâI thought it was going to be very heavy and chalky. You have to work it out a little bit more, but it has a beautiful textureâitâs very velvety. If I do use a chemical sunscreenâprobably if Iâm wearing more makeup that dayâI like Charlotte Tilbury Invisible UV Flawless Primer SPF 50. It sits really well, and itâs a nice primer for makeup so you donât have to add an additional step. Then I actually keep Vacationâs Chardonnay Oil SPF 30 on my dresserâI put it on my hands before I go outside.
Tech
I love a good tool, even though your hands are ultimately the best. I get very puffy if I so much as look at a piece of sushi, and I love using Joanna Czechâs Facial Massager. It refuses to break. The NuFace is something that you have to use all of the timeâyou canât just one and done itâbut itâs good and really does lift everything. I was so skeptical about the Droplette when it first came out, but when my skin was really dry last year, I was using some of their Collagen Hydrofiller Capsules and my skin felt like a bouncy marshmallow afterward. When I have it out on the sink, it sort of looks like a vibratorâthatâs actually a common problem in the beauty world. Is it a vibrator or a facial tool? Who knows? [Laughs] Thatâs the fun part.â

Regular physical activity is vital for anyone trying to lose or maintain a healthy weight.
You can do many things that burn body fat, create a calorie deficit, and help you get in shape. The real question is: Which cardiovascular exercise is best for weight loss?
Swimming, cycling, and running are all excellent workouts if you do them consistently. But if you enjoy running youâre in luck, running can be a great way to burn calories and promote weight loss. Compared to these other forms of exercise, one study shows that running burns more calories per mile, because it takes more time to run a mile rather than biking.
If youâre starting your journey to better health and are considering running for weight loss, this guide will provide seven easy tips that will have you up and running (pun intended) before you know it.
Yes, you can.
But note that itâs impossible to specifically go running to lose belly fat because thatâs not how exercise works. You can do crunches all day to strengthen your abdomen, but the only way to shrink your belly is by losing overall body fat, and running is a terrific option.
Of course, going for a run isnât the only effective way to lose weight. For example, this 20-minute high-intensity interval training can help torch calories even faster.
But if you prefer less intense exercise levels, running is a great way to go.

A decade ago, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory released a study showing the positive correlation between running and weight loss. More recently, a Czech study of over 1,000 adult runners confirmed earlier findings, concluding that a regular running workout to lose weight improves physical fitness. It does this by significantly reducing body fat under the skin as well as around your organs.
Translation: Jogging for weight loss works.
So, if youâre a beginner determined to lose weight running, keep reading to learn how to start racking up the miles and shedding pounds in no time.
When youâre focused on a long-term goal, the little details matter. Use these strategies to get the most out of your runs.
Not all runs are created equal. So before you lace up, itâs good to know about the different types, their benefits, and which are best for beginners running for weight loss.
Some new runners are so focused on losing weight that they make critical fueling mistakes â such as not eating enough carbs â that can impede their long-term goals.
Thatâs why one of the best ways to lose weight from running is to combine it with a diet that supports physical activity.
If youâve never run before or arenât used to regular exercise, itâs normal to be intimidated at first.
The good news is you donât have to start with running. First-timers can begin by simply walking every day. For some people, a half-hour walk may even burn more fat than a thirty minute workout.
Starting slow has the added benefits of being more enjoyable and sustainable while minimizing the risk of injury. As you get more comfortable and your body adjusts to the new exercise routine, you can slowly progress from walking to running.
Once youâre running on a regular basis, thereâs something else to look forward to.
Youâve probably heard of the euphoric experience during long runs caused by the brain releasing endorphins and neurochemicals. Good news: Runnerâs high is a real thing.
Although you arenât likely to hit a ârunnerâs highâ as a beginner, itâs something to look forward to as you slowly build up the pace, frequency, and distance of your runs.
Fun fact: 5,720 workouts are tracked per minute in the MyFitnessPal app.
Every runner needs to stay hydrated, but itâs crucial for beginners demanding more from their bodies.
Hydration provides energy, improves performance, affects mood and breathing, and may even increase your metabolic rate. The risks associated with dehydration range from minor headaches and cramping to severe complications such as heart disease and heat stroke. Apps like MyFitnessPal are incredibly useful for beginners since they help you track your hydration throughout the day.
Going for a run is a great workout, but youâre unlikely to see any changes in your current weight without consistency.
One way to keep yourself on track is to create a running schedule to lose weight. Whether you start with one or two runs per week or choose a more frequent routine, staying disciplined will help your body adjust faster.
Regardless of your weight loss running plan, stick to your schedule and be consistent in order to make the most of your running for long-term improvement. With MyFitnessPal, you can factor the calories you lose during a run into your daily caloric goals, giving you an extra boost of motivation to get out there and hit the pavement.
Yes, we mentioned it, but itâs worth repeating the importance of a balanced, nutritious diet to complement physical activity.
Some people are so excited to see results when they start running that they try to accelerate their weight loss by eating less. Methods such as yo-yo dieting arenât sustainable and can have a negative impact, including regaining all the weight lost running.
Finally, getting enough sleep each night is a health benefit that directly impacts weight loss by regulating metabolism and appetite, improving running endurance, and keeping hunger hormones in check. With sleep features, MyFitnessPal can also provide invaluable insights about your sleep patterns, helping you optimize your sleep by identifying foods inhibiting sleep.

Although running can help you reach your goals, weight loss isnât a trip around the block.
A run/walk program is fantastic for jump-starting your journey, but keeping the weight off long-term requires consistency and a diet that accounts for caloric intake.
Thatâs where MyFitnessPal can help. With the right tools and resources, you can overcome past hurdles, take the mystery out of weight loss, and help achieve your fitness goals once and for all.

She is also an RYT-200 yoga teacher and NASM CPT personal trainer.
Katherine Basbaum, MS RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She received her Masters in Nutrition Communication from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University and completed her Dietetic Internship at UVA Health, where she also works as a nutrition counselor for cardiology patients.
Over the past few years, kimchi has become one of the trendier health foods. The traditional Korean dish made of fermented cabbage and/or radishes started popping up everywhere: on tacos, folded into fried rice, even in Bloody Marys.
People touted not only the flavor but also the health benefits. And now, thereâs potentially another valid reason to eat more of it.
A new study in South Korea reported that kimchi can reduce the risk of obesity.
But before you go raiding the Asian aisle at the nearest grocery store, we talked to registered dietitian Katherine Basbaum, MS, RD, to find out whether or not the study is really accurateâand whether or not kimchi can prevent obesity.
In the study, which was published in the medical journal BMJ Open, researchers evaluated over 115,000 Korean adults between the ages of 40 to 69. They found that of those surveyed, men who consumed one to three servings of cabbage kimchi per day had a lower risk of obesity compared to men who ate less than one serving per day.
Additionally, women in the same age group who ate one to three servings of radish kimchi per day experienced a lower risk of abdominal obesity than those who didnât.
So whatâs so special about kimchi? Katherine says itâs all about the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which is a probiotic derived from the unique fermentation process.
Like many probiotics, LAB can boost your immune system, reduce inflammation, and improve your digestion. It can also potentially help prevent certain conditions, from colds and congestion to cancer and heart disease.
Katherine describes kimchi as a âflavorful, low calorie, high-fiber side dish.â However, she cautions that kimchi can be high in sodium, so be mindful of that if youâre watching your salt intake.
Thereâs no denying that kimchi can be part of a healthy diet. But as for whether or not it prevents obesity, thatâs up for debate. Katherine pointed out some big flaws with this particular study.
So if kimchi isnât the answer, what is?
âThough there are unfortunately no specific foods that have been proven to play a significant role in lowering obesity risk, there are most definitely dietary strategies that can help,â Katherine says. (Like tracking your foodâ¦ MyFitnessPal can help with that!)

She recommends limiting âenergy denseâ foods, which are foods high in fat, sugar, and calories (think: anything processed). Instead, opt for âlow energy denseâ foodsâlike fruits, vegetables, and whole grainsâthat are high in water and/or fiber and will keep you fuller with fewer calories.
And as always, moderation is key. In the study conclusion, researchers reported that âexcessive consumption suggests the potential for an increase in obesity prevalence.â Too much of a good thing isnât always a good thingâeven if youâre eating something good for you, like kimchi.

Fitness,5/4/2024,19:19:05,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/ultra-processed-foods-that-are-dietitian-approved/,10 Ultra-Processed Foods That Are Dietitian Approved,1519,"Catrina Cowart is a writer and editor with over 14 years of professional experience. As a long-time freelance and agency writer, she focuses on writing in niches including health and wellness, medical, legal, travel, the arts, and science and technology.
Emily Sullivan, RD is a food data curator at MyFitnessPal. She earned her bachelor's degree and completed her dietetic internship at The Ohio State University, and obtained her culinary arts degree from Johnson and Wales University. Her experience extends from nutrition research, oncology nutrition, culinary nutrition education and recipe development.
Youâve probably come across articles and social media posts saying that ultra-processed foods are bad for your health. And sure, there may be some truth to this. But the nutritional value of all ultra-processed foods found isnât always black or white. That is, not all ultra-processed foods are created equal.
So, you might think you need to toss out all your deli meats or salad dressings to skip overly processed foods, but thatâs not necessarily the case. In fact, some ultra-processed foods can still play a positive role in your diet.
We spoke to several dietitians to get their advice on ultra-processed foods and when to add or cut them out of your diet. Hereâs what you should know.
Ultra-processed foods (UPF) are typically packaged foods that have been created with manufactured ingredientsâaka, things you wouldnât normally find in a kitchen.
By definition, they are âformulations of ingredients and food substances, some of which are not used in culinary preparations, to imitate the qualities of unprocessed or minimally processed items. They can also include ingredients that disguise any undesirable final product.â
Translated to English, theyâre typically packaged foods that have been created with manufactured ingredientsâaka, things you wouldnât normally find in a kitchen.
Does that mean you have to cut these foods out of your meal meal planning? You may be surprised by the answer.
A lot of people think that super-processed foods are basically junk and should be avoided whenever possible. But according to Emily Sullivan, a dietitian who works with MyFitnessPal, thatâs not always true.
âOne of the biggest misconceptions about ultra-processed foods is that they all provide little to no nutritional value,â she says. âIn reality, this food classification doesnât reference the actual nutritional contents of the food, only the degree to which it was processed.â
Simply put: there are exceptions. In fact, in a study back in 2023, the USDA found that a predesigned menu where almost all the calories came from super-processed foods still provided most of the nutrients you need to stay healthy, except for a few like Choline, vitamin D, and vitamin E.
Ultra-processed foods can be all over the map when it comes to how nutritious they are for you. Thatâs probably why the research shows that eating a diet rich in ultra-processed foods often leads to negative health outcomes.
But, by keeping an eye on sugar, fat, salt, and calories, you can still fit them into your diet in moderation. Eating ultra-processed foods with higher nutritional values will be the key to success and improved diet quality.
Hereâs a list of ultra-processed foods that MyFitnessPalâs dietitians give a thumbs up to.
Soy milk and unsweetened almond milk are considered ultra-processed foods, but theyâre both great choices for your diet. Fortified soy milk is a good source of Vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium, and protein (with 7g to 9g per serving). Soy milk also lacks saturated fat, which is found in cowâs milk.
Unsweetened almond milk is a good alternative for those who donât want to drink soy or cowâs milk. It is also a UPF but doesnât have high amounts of added sugar or sodium.
Whole grain crackers may fall into the processed or ultra-processed food categories. Yet they are an excellent source of whole grains and a convenient way to get some top nutrients, including fiber, vitamin E, and B vitamins. For an added benefit, you can combine these crackers with less processed foods and bulk up on other necessary nutrients.
Protein powders often fall into the processed, and sometimes ultra-processed, categories. But they can be a great solution for those who struggle to get enough protein in their diets!
Alternatively, protein bars are more likely to be ultra-processed foods but are still a good way to increase protein intake, especially for busy individuals.
Salad dressing helps add flavor to what might otherwise be a bland salad, but like many other condiments, dressings are often ultra-processed. When you purchase salad dressing, be sure to read the label and try to identify the best-quality dressing available. Look for salad dressings low in added sugar and saturated fat.
Rice cakes are beneficial because they have few carbohydrates, and they work well as bases for peanut butter and chocolate chips, nut butter, berries, or other add-ons. Donât forget to check the food labels before buying these UPFs, since some rice cakes have additives or are loaded up with added sugarâ something that Americans tend to over-consume.
Breakfast cereals come in a wide range of flavors, colors, and textures. Some are super sweet, and there are many you may want to find alternatives on a quest to eat a more nutritious diet.
But you should know that even whole grain, lightly sweetened breakfast cereals are ultra-processed foods. While keeping that in mind, look for cereals that contain fewer than 10g of added sugar per serving.
A good option? Kashi Go Peanut Butter Crunch cereal. It has 8g of fiber, 10g of protein, and 9g of added sugars per serving, making it a good choice for your first meal of the day.

Eating whole-grain bread is another good way to add whole grains to your diet. When commercially produced, this type of bread is ultra-processed. However, getting over half your grains from whole-grain sources is still recommended.
Whole-grain foods are full of vitamins and nutrients, and they are rich in fiber. Fiber can help reduce blood cholesterol levels and may help you reduce the risk of developing heart disease, too. Check the nutrition label to ensure the bread youâre eating is whole grain. The first ingredient should be âwhole grain.â
Out of this entire list of ultra-processed foods, Greek yogurt is one of the few with gut-friendly probiotics. Itâs known that eating these probiotics can have a positive effect on diseases such as diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular conditions.
When shopping for yogurt, look for one with no more than 5g of added sugar.
There are several types of soy-based meat alternatives, including Morningstar veggie burgers and chikân nuggets. These are both classified as ultra-processed foods but can be a good choice as a plant-based protein alternative.
Soy-based meat products donât have as much saturated fat as real meat, making them an excellent solution for those looking for high-protein meat alternatives at lunch or dinner.
Tomato-based pasta sauces in jars often fall into the ultra-processed category, but theyâre not necessarily an unhealthy option. Check the ingredients when you choose your next tomato or spaghetti sauce, as some will have less added sugar or salt.
If you want to add additional vegetables to your diet, consider choosing a tomato-based pasta sauce with carrots or onions in the mix. Put this sauce over whole-grain pasta to make an easy meal with nutritional benefits.
When you look at all the ultra-processed foods around you, it can be hard to imagine how you will avoid those that could be harmful while still retaining the healthier UPFs in your diet.
Fortunately, if you eat the items on this list in combination with unprocessed foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, youâll build a well-rounded diet that contains the nutrients your body needs to be at its best.
Use MyFitnessPal to keep track of the calories in the foods youâre eating. Track all added sugars and fats, and keep an eye on your sodium intake. If youâre consuming more than the recommended amount, place a focus back on the UPFs youâre eating and see if you can cut back or swap them out for more nutrient-dense UPFs.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:51,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/jackie-shuya-tan-instagram-model-beauty-routine/,"Jackie Shuya Tan, Model + Creative Editor, Instagram",1114,"âI love my job. Iâm a creative editor for Instagramâs own account, @instagram, which means I work with creators and other creatives to feature them and their work. Outside of that, Iâm also a model. Iâve done a lot of work for beauty brands like Kosas and Peach and Lily, as well as some runway. I just walked for Rui Zhou, and I walked for Kim Shui, Pronounce, and Eckahus Latta in the past.
Through my job, I go to a lot of events, but I also love to eat, so my perfect night out is eating out with my friends and having a laugh. I love Chinese food. Che Li is really good. Uluh on 9th and 2nd Avenue is also great. If itâs not Chinese, I like going to Commerce Inn. It has an old school British vibe. Buvette and I Sodi are also in the rotation. And I really love Haâs Äáº·c Biá»t. Itâs a pop-up. They just did a month-long one at Gem. Itâs some of the best food in New York City.
For a late night out, my friends and I are going to Basement or Paragon in Bushwick. Then, if I want a snack when Iâm home, I usually have pizza. Thereâs 2 Bros and Village Square. I also love the vegan burger and waffle fries from Jerrellâs Betr Brgr. They have a vegan cookies and cream shake thatâs amazing. Itâs made with oat milk, but it tastes just like a normal milkshake.

SKINCARE
I do a full skincare routine before I go out. The first thing I use is Biologique Rechercheâs micellar water, followed by their cleansing milk VIP O2. The cleansing milk has a great slip, so I like to use my gua sha with it. Double cleansing has been great for me. My pores look a lot smaller since I started doing it. Then I use either AÄsopâs Lucent Facial Concentrate, which is a really good vitamin C, or Ranuâs Copper Brightening Serum, which my facialist, Kristyn Smith, recommended. I also really like Biologique Rechercheâs Oligo-ProtÃ©ines Marines for brightening. And I love their Amniotique VG SÃ©rum for hydration and the Lotion P50 PIGM 400 for exfoliating. I feel like my face looks tighter after I use it. For eye cream, I really like Officine Universelle Bulyâs Vide Poche. It has more of a serum consistency and comes in a roll-on.
I love how the Sulwhasoo Ginseng Cream smells. I grew up drinking and eating ginseng, so I love having it in my beauty products, too. Also, the texture is really goodâitâs worth the price tag. If itâs still light out, Iâll put on my La Mer SPF 50 on my face and neck. I know some people love La Mer and others donât like it at all, but Iâve tried other sunscreens, and this one is my favorite. It doesnât leave a white cast. Then, if Iâm wearing a dress, Iâll put on Kiehlâs Whipped Body Butter. Itâs really hydrating and makes your skin look so fresh.

MAKEUP
Whenever I go out, I have to have lip liner. I love Charlotte Tilbury lip liner in Pillow Talk. Then I add a little bit of the Dior Addict Lip Glow in 12 Rosewood. It has more of a balm consistency, and I like it because itâs light. If I want lip gloss on top, I wear Fenty Beautyâs Lip Luminizer in Fenty Glow Heat. You should definitely use it if you want your lips to be plump, which I love. It stings a little, but itâs manageable.
I use concealer very sparingly, but if I need to cover up a blemish, I like the Radiant Creamy Concealer from NARS. I use shade M2 Ginger. Itâs so light and never cakey. I also love Pat McGrathâs Skin Fetish Highlighter & Balm Duo. I use the Bronze version. Itâs a stick, so itâs really easy to use and carry with you. The highlighter adds the perfect touch of sparkle on my cheekbones, and sometimes Iâll run the balm on my eyelids for a dewy vibe. If I want actual eyeshadow, I use Diorâs Backstage Palette in 002 Cool Neutrals. I blend it all with my fingers. The fewer tools, the better.
The only curler that works for my super straight lashes is the one from Shu Uemura. And I only use brown eyeliner. I don't like using black; itâs too intense. Iâve gotten all of my makeup tips from my friends, and one of them told me that Asians should only use brown eyeliner. I donât even really know why. Heâs also Asian and really into makeup, so I do what he tells me. Diorâs liquid eyeliner is my favorite.

HAIR
I usually wash my hair once a week. I like Oribeâs Signature Shampoo and Conditioner. I love the smell, and they make my hair feel luscious. Their Gold Lust Nourishing Hair Oil is my go-to for my endsâI never apply it on my rootsâbut I also love the Huile Magique d'Argan Bio from Le Jardin de Sidi B. Itâs an argan oil I picked up from Morocco. My hair is naturally very straightâI donât own a straightenerâso I just go with it. I just brush it through with a wild boar bristle brush from Officine Universelle. I also use one of their Architect combs to do my center part.
FRAGRANCE
I like feminine perfumes with a twist. Like, I want a floral but not straight on. Byredoâs Inflorescence has that vibe. It has rose petals, lily of the valley, and magnolia, but itâs not overly sweet. I also wear Gold Leaves from RÃ©gime des Fleurs. Itâs very unique, still floral but it also has amber and cardamom. Angeli di Firenze from Santa Maria Novella is also really nice, but that oneâs more fruity. When it comes to candles, I turn to Hawthorne, which was co-founded by one of my friends. I really love Aromatic and Woody and Botanic Blur. Otherwise, Iâm burning Ptolemy Aromatique from AÄsop.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:01,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/victoria-beckham-beauty-top-shelf-full-routine/,"Victoria Beckham, Founder, Victoria Beckham Beauty",2231,"âI started Victoria Beckham Beauty because I knew that there was an appetite for itâbut I wanted to do it in the way that I wanted to, with a real focus on clean beauty. Product ingredients are key. In the past, I struggled with my skin for so many years. When I was younger, I was seeing dermatologists who put me on all sorts of antibiotics and different topical solutions, and I decided to take the power back and really focus on what I was putting in and on my body. That meant looking at what I was eating but also the formulas that I was putting on my face. Of course, I still wanted our products to work, and that was challenging for my product development team and our labs, but we did it. I think thatâs what makes us best in class.
SKINCARE
My skin has definitely become drier. It was oilier when I was younger and I didnât like that, but as you age, you realize itâs quite good if youâve got oily skin. I was very fortunate that I didnât scar from the acne, but maybe if I had dry skin, I would have. I kept all skin types in mind when developing my Daily Cleansing Protocol, a duo consisting of an oil cleanser and a lactic acid gel cleanser. When I struggled with my skin, I couldnât find the perfect cleanser. They would either irritate my skin and cause more breakouts or they were overly drying. You can either use my cleansers together or individually. At night, I use the oil cleanser first because it really does get the dirt and makeup off your faceâso many cleansers claim to take makeup off but actually donâtâwithout stripping the natural oils that you want to hang on to. Then Iâll use the gel cleanser after that. But if Iâm traveling and my skin is feeling a little drier, maybe Iâll just use the oil cleanser. Since the gel cleaner has lactic acid, you can use it once or twice a day, depending on your skin type. I like to use it on its own in the morning.
I developed the cleansers with Melanie Grant, who is a facialist I met years ago in Australia. She has been my skin guru since then. She is remarkable. She only ever uses the best in class products and she would always send me products to try. Sheâs actually the person that introduced me to Augustinus Bader years ago, so she is the one responsible for me collaborating with the brand. Like me, sheâs struggled to find the perfect cleanser, which is why we decided to work together on the duo. She really is skin obsessed, and itâs been such a joy working with her.

If I have time after cleansing, I might use my Celluma Pro, which Iâm quite obsessed with at the moment. Iâve genuinely noticed a difference in my skin texture since I started using it. Then I use my Augustinus Bader Cell Rejuvenating Power Serum, making sure that I press it into my skin, neck, and chest area quite firmly, followed by my Augustinus Bader Cell Rejuvenating Priming MoisturizerâI feel like I have the perfect foundation for makeup with those two on. If Iâm being completely honest, I do not use sunscreen every day. Well... I'll use it if Iâm in Miami.
I recently worked with IvÃ¡n Pol, better known as The Beauty Sandwich, when I was in LA. He gave me the most perfect facial treatment before walking the 'Lola' red carpet. In terms of facial treatments I can do at home, Iâm a big fan of rollers and gua shas, especially in the mornings. The Skin Gym face roller and the Sisley Ginkgo Gua Sha are especially brilliant post flights and for depuffing. I also love the 111Skin Illuminating Rose Gold Eye Masks in the mornings, either as part of my skincare routine or whilst blowing out my hairâI want to use every minute wisely for extra skincare benefits.
MAKEUP
I always love a smoky, sexy eye. I will often start with my Smoky Eye Brick in Signature, combined with my Eyewear in Pecanâor sometimes Bottle Greenâto contour the eye area. Then I use my Satin Kajal Liner just above the lash line and also a little bit underneath. If Iâm going out at night, I go from using Cocoa to Cinnamon. Sometimes Iâll even use a bit of Sequin Green or Navy Noir if I want to have a little bit of a different take on my smoky eye. Quite often I use my Instant Brightening Waterline Pencil on the inside of my eye as well because sometimes using a darker color can be too much during the daytime. That said, I love a light touch. I do really love to wear makeup, but I have a less-is-more approach. When I contour, for example, I donât like it to look like Iâve contoured. And I love lip liners, but I donât want it to look too obvious that Iâve lined my lips. Iâve had the pleasure of working with [photographer] Peter Lindbergh quite a few times, and heâs all about a smoky eye, but itâs always smudgy and sexyânever harsh. It looks almost more like a natural shadow as opposed to a hard line.

I donât really do a lot with my brows. I always say that Anastasia Soare, who is a very good friend of mine, is my eyebrow guru. Upon her recommendation I used Latisse for both my lashes and brows, and it helped to grow them back, but I havenât used it in quite a while. These days, Iâm obsessed with our Babyblade. I searched for the right brow product for a long time, something that came in a small enough component so that I could really get a precise application and carefully pencil individual hairs. Iâve never found a brow product quite like ours, which is why I decided to develop it myself. I use shade Medium Brown.
As far as lips go, I always line mine with my Lip Definer in shade No.2âI have about three of these in different bags at any one timeâand then add my Posh Gloss on top. My go-to shades are Poolside and Picante.
HAIR
My hair is quite simple, really. I donât do too much. Ken Paves, who is my best friend and hairdresser, is the only person that I let cut it. He is a genius. When it comes to hair, the more volume the better. But I do not like to feel too much texture in my hair, so Ken has a very light touch on productsâheâll use Wellaâs Sugar Lift hairspray and L'Oreal Parisâ Elnett Satin Extra Strong Hold after a blowout. For my color, I go to Josh Wood, who is the master of hair color, in London. I was introduced to Milbonâs shampoo and Restorative Treatment by a friend, and Iâm really liking the products. Harper has become quite obsessed with them, as well.
NAILS
I like my nails to be quite long. I either like a nude nail or a dark colorâit depends on what Iâm wearing to be honest. For ease, most of the time I wear a natural color because I create content quite often and I like my nails to not stand out too much. My philosophy is that a dark nail looks gorgeous if youâre wearing tailoring or if youâre going out for the night, but I also like to dress in quite a lot of color, and if I have a different color on my nails, I start to question what Iâm wearing.
Iâve known [nail artist] Tom Bachik for years. I havenât worked with him for a long time because heâs based in Los Angeles and Iâm based in London, but heâs great and very talented. I have a great girl that I work with in Miami. I have someone great in London as well, but honestly, I like to try new people depending on what Iâm doing.

FRAGRANCE
Diptyque is my go-to candle brandâI go back and forth between Feu de Bois and Baies. Years and years and years ago, I made a fragrance called Intimately Beckham with my husband. I really enjoyed the process of creating it. But just like with my makeup, I didnât want to compromise and I wanted to do things my way, so about eight years ago I started working with JÃ©rÃ´me Ãpinette, who is the most amazing perfumer. I knew that I had to take my time with the fragrances we worked onâwhich resulted in Suite 302, San Ysidro Drive, and Portofino â97âbecause independently launching a fragrance is a huge undertaking. I was in absolutely no rush.
I feel quite vulnerable when I talk about the three scents because Iâd never told those stories about my personal life before. San Ysidro Drive is named after the address my family and I relocated to in 2007. Every time I smell it, it takes me back to those early days in LA. It was also where I started focusing on my fashion career. It was a very special time for me as a woman to work on myself.
Suite 302 really takes me back. I would say itâs a tribute to the love affair that David and I have with Paris. In the â90s, we would often sneak away to Parisâjust the two of us. We would stay at the Hotel Costes. When we lived in Spain, we dropped the kids off at school one morning, and David said to me, âIâm going to take you somewhere for the day.â We drove to the airport, got on a private plane, and halfway through the flight, David went into the bathroom and came back out in a tuxedo looking so handsome. He said, âThereâs something for you to put on in the bathroom.â There was a white dress hanging up, so I put that and some makeup on. We landed in London, and there was the chauffeur-driven car that drove us to our wedding all those years ago. We drove to the house that we used to have in North London. We had a little chapel on the grounds, and he had covered the whole chapel with flowers. My parents were there. His parents were there. We had the vicar that married us all those years ago remarry us. It was the most romantic thing that heâs ever done. Then we went back to the airport and back on the plane. I had no idea where we were going again. We landed in Paris and had a mini honeymoon that was literally 24 hours long. We stayed at The Ritz in Suite 302.

I was in the Spice Girls when David and I first met. He was living in Manchester playing for Manchester United, and he would drive down to London. We literally would meet in a car park at a restaurant called City Limits. We would sit in his car and talk and really get to know each other. A friend at the time said, âYou know, when people find out that you two are dating, everyone is going to go crazy. Thereâs going to be paparazzi everywhere.â The same friend said, âWhen people know about you, take a trip. Do something special. The first trip that you should take should be to Portofino. Thereâs this amazing hotel called Hotel Splendido.â That was the first time that we ever went away together, the first time that we were on a private plane together. We had 48 hours. Up until that point, every time we saw each other, it almost felt like a stolen moment because we were both so busy. The intensity of the two of us being together for that 48 hours really was amazing. I remember the blue skies. I remember how it smelt. I remember how excited I was to be with him for the first time.
I love each one. I wear them all depending on where Iâm going, who Iâm with, what Iâm doing, where I happen to be, and what Iâm wearing. Theyâre all genderless. Suite 302 is my perfect date night fragrance. Itâs very sexy. I love the tobacco note. It feels very elegant, very chic, and very cool. Thereâs just something strong, powerful, and sexy about Suite 302. During the day, I switch between Portofino and San Ysidro. I love the modern take on a rose that you get with San Ysidro and how fresh Portofino feels. You can also combine the fragrances as well, so you can almost customize them. Theyâre all I wear at the moment.â

Quantum Computers Can Now Run Powerful AI That Works like the Brain
The influential AI design that makes chatbots tick now runs on quantum computers
By Rahul Rao

Few computer science breakthroughs have done so much in so little time as the artificial intelligence design known as a transformer. A transformer is a form of deep learningâa machine model based on networks in the brainâthat researchers at Google first proposed in 2017. Seven years later the transformer, which enables ChatGPT and other chatbots to quickly generate sophisticated outputs in reply to user prompts, is the dynamo powering the ongoing AI boom. As remarkable as this AI design has already proved to be, what if you could run it on a quantum computer?
That might sound like some breathless mash-up proposed by an excitable tech investor. But quantum-computing researchers are now in fact asking this very question out of sheer curiosity and the relentless desire to make computers do new things. A new study published recently in Quantum used simple hardware to show that rudimentary quantum transformers could indeed work, hinting that more developed quantum-AI combinations might solve crucial problems in areas including encryption and chemistryâat least in theory.
A transformerâs superpower is its ability to discern which parts of its input are more important than others and how strongly those parts connect. Take the sentence âShe is eating a green apple.â A transformer could pick out the sentenceâs key words: âeating,â âgreenâ and âapple.â Then, based on patterns identified in its training data, it would judge that the action âeatingâ has little to do with the color âgreenâ but a great deal more to do with the object âapple.â Computer scientists call this feature an âattention mechanism,â meaning it pays the most attention to the most important words in a sentence, pixels in an image or proteins in a sequence. The attention mechanism mimics how humans process language, performing a task that is elementary for most young children but thatâuntil the ChatGPT eraâcomputers had struggled with.

Attention mechanisms currently run on supercomputers with powerful processors, but they still use basic binary bits that hold values of either 0 or 1. Physicists describe these as âclassicalâ machines, which also include smartphones and PCs. Quantum hardware, on the other hand, taps into the weirdness of quantum mechanics to solve problems too impractical for classical computers. Thatâs because quantum bits, aka qubits, can exist as a 0, a 1 or a spectrum of other possible states. So could developers build a superior attention mechanism using qubits? âQuantum computers are not expected to be a computational panacea, but we wonât know until we try,â says quantum computing researcher Christopher Ferrie at the University of Technology Sydney, who wasnât involved with the new study.
An author of the study, Jonas Landman, had previously crafted quantum facsimiles of other brainlike AI designs to run on quantum hardware. âWe wanted to look at transformers because they seemed to be the state of the art of deep learning,â says Landman, a quantum computing researcher at the University of Edinburgh and a computing firm called QC Ware. In the new research, he and his colleagues adapted a transformer designed for medical analysis. From a database of images of 1,600 peopleâs retinas, some in healthy eyes and some in people with diabetes-induced blindness, the quantum model sorted each image into one of five levels from no damage to the most severe.
Developing their quantum transformer was a three-step process. First, before even touching any quantum hardware, they needed to design a quantum circuitâa quantum programâs âcode,â in other wordsâfor a transformer. They made three versions, each of which could theoretically pay attention more efficiently than a classical transformer, as demonstrated by mathematical proofs.
Bolstered by confidence from the math, the study authors tested their designs on a quantum simulatorâa qubit emulator that runs on classical hardware. Emulators avoid a problem plaguing todayâs real quantum computers, which are still so sensitive to heat, electromagnetic waves and other interference that qubits can become muddled or entirely useless.
On the simulator, each quantum transformer categorized a set of retinal images with between 50 and 55 percent accuracyâgreater than the 20 percent accuracy that randomly sorting retinas into one of five categories would have achieved. The 50- to 55-percent range was about the same accuracy level (53 to 56 percent) achieved by two classical transformers with vastly more complex networks.
Only after this could the scientists move on to the third step: operating their transformers on real IBM-made quantum computers, using up to six qubits at a time. The three quantum transformers still performed with between 45 and 55 percent accuracy.
Six qubits is not very many. For a viable quantum transformer to match the chatbot giants of Googleâs Gemini or OpenAIâs ChatGPT, some researchers think computer scientists would have to create a code that uses hundreds of qubits. Quantum computers of that size already exist, but designing a comparatively colossal quantum transformer isnât yet practical because of the interference and potential errors involved. (The researchers tried higher qubit numbers but did not see the same success.)
The group isnât alone in its work on transformers. Last year researchers at IBMâs Thomas J. Watson Research Center proposed a quantum version of a transformer type known as a graph transformer. And in Australia, Ferrieâs group has designed its own transformer quantum circuit concept. That team is still working on the first step that QC Ware passed: mathematically testing the design before trying it out.
But suppose a reliable quantum computer existedâone with more than 1,000 qubits and where interference is somehow kept to a minimum. Would a quantum transformer, then, always have the advantage? Maybe not. Head-to-head comparisons between quantum and classical transformers are not the right approach because the two probably have different strengths.
For one thing, classical computers have the benefit of investment and familiarity. Even as quantum-computing technology matures, âIt will take many years for quantum computers to scale up to that regime, and classical computers wonât stop growing in the meantime,â says Nathan Killoran, head of software at quantum computing firm Xanadu, who was not involved with the new research. âClassical machine learning is just so powerful and so well financed that it may just not be worth it to replace it entirely with an emerging technology like quantum computing in our lifetimes.â
Additionally, quantum computers and classical machine learning each excel at different kinds of problems. Modern deep-learning algorithms detect patterns within their training data. Itâs possible that qubits can learn to encode the same patterns, but it is not clear if they are optimal for the task. Thatâs because qubits offer the greatest advantage when a problem is âunstructured,â meaning its data have no clear patterns to find in the first place. Imagine trying to find a name in a phone book with no alphabetization or order of any kind; a quantum computer can find that word in the square root of the time a classical computer would take.
But the two options are not exclusive. Many quantum researchers believe a quantum transformerâs ideal place will be as part of a classical-quantum hybrid system. Quantum computers could handle the trickier problems of chemistry and materials science, while a classical system crunches through volumes of data. Quantum systems might also prove valuable at generating dataâdecrypted cryptographic keys, for example, or the properties of materials that donât yet exist, both of which are hard for classical computers to doâthat could in turn help train classical transformers to perform tasks that now remain largely inaccessible.
And quantum transformers may bring other bonuses. Classical transformers, at the scales they are now being used, consume so much energy that U.S. utilities are keeping carbon-spewing coal plants operational just to meet new data centersâ power demands. The dream of a quantum transformer is also the dream of a leaner, more efficient machine that lightens the energy load.

Plant-based meat alternatives are having their moment in the sun, even for consumers who arenât full-time vegetarians or vegans.
Did you know seven in 10 Americans eat plant-based foods and return for more? Of the households buying plant-based meals, 80% are repeat buyers.
Health is a primary reason people go plant-based, and science backs that choice. Eating more plant-based foods can help you reduce certain health risks, like heart disease and high blood pressure.
Fortunately, there are plenty of meat alternatives to explore. One popular comparison is tempeh vs. tofu vs. seitan â the plant-based trifecta.
Letâs dive in.
According to the Institute of Medicine, protein should make up 10% to 35% of your calories. This includes plant-based proteins.
Tofu, or bean curd, is a popular meat substitute consisting of soybeans and water. The soy-water mix becomes tofu when you add a coagulant, which thickens and binds the mixture.
There are three types of tofu coagulants:
Each has a different chemical effect on soy protein. Scientists are studying all three to learn which makes the best tofu.
TL;DR: Tofu consists of soybeans and water that are made into a paste with a binding agent.
Tofu gets harder when you press more water out of it. The tofu industry has sorted tofuâs different hardnesses into three basic types:
Most commercial tofu has one of these labels or a variation. âMedium-firmâ or âextra-firmâ are popular options.
In the end, though, tofu is a spectrum. The more water you press out, the firmer it gets.
Tofu is soy, which offers a long list of health benefits. For example:
Different types of tofu have different nutrition profiles. For example, firmer tofu has a higher protein content than softer tofu. Itâs denser, so it contains more soy per square inch.
You can find specific in theÂ MyFitnessPal app. It might even inspire you to try a new type!
TL;DR: Tofu is good for your heart health and can help your body meet its nutrition needs and build muscle.
Tempeh is another soy-based plant protein. It traditionally comes from Indonesia, where itâs still the most popular soy product.
Making tempeh starts by soaking the soybeans, typically overnight, then boiling, draining, and fermenting them. The boiled soybeans are then mixed with a fungus called Rhizopus oligosporus. Some people call this âtempeh starter.â
The fermentation process takes a day or two. During that time, a white mold grows over the beans. It binds them into a large sheet, which you can cut and cook.
TL;DR: Tempeh is fermented, soaked soybeans made into a solid block.
Tempeh and tofu are both soy-based and worth trying if youâre interested in a plant-based diet and can eat soy. But no, tofu and tempeh are not the same food.
Tempeh is fermented, so it has a different taste and texture. The fermentation process also changes the nutritional profile.
Letâs look at the nutritional difference between tempeh and tofu. Using the MyFitnessPal app, we can compare 3 oz. servings of tempeh and firm tofu.
The tempeh has:
So, in the tempeh vs. tofu protein face-off, tempeh is the clear winner. Tempeh also has more dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin A.
But nutrients arenât the only consideration. Tempeh has a stronger taste. Itâs known for its bold and nutty flavor, while tofu is famously neutral and takes on a dishâs highlight flavors.
TL;DR: Tempeh or tofu? Tempeh wins for protein and contains more carbs than tofu. It also has a stronger taste.
A 3 oz. serving of tempeh contains:
Most of the fat in tempeh is unsaturated, with a ratio of about two grams of unsaturated to one gram of saturated. There are no trans fats.
If you have celiac disease â or any gluten intolerance â youâll want to skip this section. But if your body is okay with wheat, itâs time to try seitan, a vegan protein made from wheat gluten.
You get seitan by extracting the gluten from wheat and mixing it with water. Add some spices, and voilÃ ! Seitan.
Protein from gluten. Who knew?
Turns out, the ancient Chinese. Legend says Buddhist monks created seitan in the sixth century CE. Even then, it was a way to eat healthier without missing out on the benefits of meat.
Seitanâs texture is so much like chicken that some people call it âwheat meat.â Itâs perfect if you want a food like tofu without tofuâs silky mouthfeel. It also makes a good substitute for tempeh if a nutty taste isnât your favorite.
The main downside? Seitan doesnât include lysine, an essential amino acid. Technically, that means seitan isnât a complete protein. But donât worry, itâs still healthy â you just need other sources of proteins, too.
TL;DR: Seitan is essentially wheat gluten, usually with spices added.
Seitan is a processed food, meaning itâs altered from its natural state. To create seitan, you must extract the gluten from its natural state within the wheat.
That said, some seitan is more processed than others. Store-bought seitan includes more preservatives so it can reach you safely.
You can also buy flavored seitan. Those products might contain sauces with added sugar, oils, and other ingredients. Always check the ingredients list for what kind of seitan youâre buying and whatâs been added.
If you want minimally processed seitan, your best bet is making it at home. The primary ingredient is vital wheat gluten, which you can buy in specialty stores.
TL;DR: Store-bought seitan is usually processed, but you can make it at home.
A 3.5 oz. serving of seitan contains:
The closest comparison, meat substitute-wise, is tempeh vs. seitan. Tempeh has slightly less protein, fewer carbs, and less fat.
Compared to tofu, seitan has significantly more protein. Tofu contains 7.6 g per 3.5 oz. serving. Seitan also has more carbs, making it a trade-off for some people.

So, seitan vs. tofu vs. tempeh. Two are soy-based, and one is wheat-based. All are versatile and have similar macro profiles. Which to choose?
As with most things food-related, it depends on you. Your nutrition needs should determine your choice of meat substitute. Of course, your sense of taste can play a part, too.
Meat alternatives absorb the flavor of whatever you cook them with. Theyâre kind of famous for it. Prepare any of these proteins with your favorite herbs and spices, et voilÃ  â customized protein.
Prepare tempeh, tofu, or seitan with your favorite herbs and spices. Instant customized protein! And download MyFitnessPal for more plant-based recipe inspiration.

âSmart Glovesâ Teach Piano Playing through Touch
A high-tech pair of gloves can help make learning instruments and other hands-on activities easier
By Riis Williams
Thomas Fuchs
Made of thin cotton and stitched together in only 20 minutes, an experimental pair of gloves isnât particularly fashionable or useful for keeping anyoneâs hands warm. Instead the accessory uses tactile sensors woven into its fabric to serve an entirely different purpose: teaching piano and other hands-on skills.
For a study in Nature Communications, Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student Yiyue Luo and her colleagues created these âsmart glovesâ using haptic technology, which incorporates physical sensations such as vibrations or force to help with tactile activities. Researchers used the gloves to record one pianistâs hand movements while playing a song. They then relayed those movements to a student through fingertip vibrations, helping the learner build muscle memory and perform the piece with greater precision. âHand-based movements like piano playing are normally really subjective and difficult to record and transfer,â Luo says. âBut with these gloves we are actually able to track one personâs touch experience and share it with another person to improve their tactile learning process.â
Using a computerized embroidery machine, the team embedded small wires linked to a pressure-sensing material in the gloves to detect hand motions. When a piano teacher wearing the gloves repeatedly performed a tune, a machine-learning algorithm processed their movement on the keys and translated it into instructional vibrations. Students wearing their own gloves then attempted to play the same tune, with the fingertip vibrations guiding them through proper movements. (The vibration intensity increased to correct fingering or rhythm mistakes.) By the trialsâ end, students who had practiced with the gloves could play more accurately than those who had not. âThis type of learning is sort of like when youâre first starting to ride a bike,â says Rice University mechanical engineer Marcia OâMalley, who was not involved in the study. âYou use the training wheels to get the sensation of properly riding the bike. Eventually you take them off and start to ride independently.â

The team also tested the glovesâ ability to aid people playing online games with a mouse and keyboard, recording motions from experienced players to guide novices. People who gamed with the glovesâ guidance scored better on average than those who did not.
Playing piano or video games is often just for fun, but OâMalley adds that with an improved algorithm, coded to identify and capture finer hand movements, the new glove technology could someday help to teach crucial practices such as surgeries. Instructional haptics âremove a step in the learning process that auditory and visual learning canât,â she says. âWhen vibration is actually felt directly at the point of action, we can act and learn quickerâand with that, thereâs so much potential.â

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:00,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/beauty-tools-skincare-spatula-scissors/,Your Top Shelf Needs Some Scissors,615,"If Iâm trying to be the woman I want to be, all of my beauty tools come out to play. I wear my Dr. Dennis Gross SpectraLite LipWare for three minutes daily. I zap my face with my ZIIP every other day. I contour my face with my Jillian Dempsey Gold Bar as I catch up on TikTok. But inevitably, I get tired, and I use them less and less until the next time inspiration strikes. Throughout it all though, there are two tools that never have to worry about a lack of interest: a pair of scissors and a long, thin skincare spatula. My absolute Top Shelf heroes.
The scissors are, well, scissors. Theyâre gray. They were just over $6 on Amazon and bought in a hurry when I moved to a new apartment. Thereâs nothing extraordinary about them. They just do their one job: cut. In my case, they cut beauty products in half in my desperate attempt to carve out every last drop. Theyâve helped me get through many a Neutrogena benzoyl peroxide container (sexy!) and Tula SPF 30 (the barista at my favorite coffee shop compliments me every time I wear it, and Iâm not about to give up that serotonin). As long as a product comes in a thin-enough plastic, itâs fair game: Toothpaste tubes. Creams. Cleansers. You name it, Iâve cut it in half. In some cases, Iâve been able to scrape enough product to last me an additional week.
The other half of the equation is a dual-ended, silicone spatula. When Soft Services launched its Carea cream, which is housed in aluminum, I started to carve out the last bits of the lotion with its pumpâit was one of the few body lotions that actually made my persistently dry skin look alive, and I wasnât about to leave even a morsel of it behind. I later turned it upside down and smacked the bottle as hard as I could, but even that left some product at the bottom.
My scissors were useless in this case, but Soft Services swooped in with a clutch solution: a dual-ended, bright orange spatula thatâs just over 6 inches long (I found an Amazon dupe here). One side is pointy to get into pesky, tiny corners, and the other side is flat, best for scraping the sides and the bottom of my containers. I know I could just dip my fingers into small-enough products, but the thought of inviting whatever bacteria is hanging out under my nails is enough to put me off that idea. The last time I called my handy spatula in for duty was last Friday. I had a tiny, sample-sized tube of Biologique Rechercheâs Masque Vivant, a pungentâthink: dark chocolate mixed with cheeseâface mask several facialists swore would help my angry chin. It was my final hail mary after a week of looking like a hormonal teenager, and my spatula was a key player. A few scoops later, the tube was as empty as possible, the evidence sitting on my skin. Hormonal breakouts may be temporary, but the spatula is forever.

AI Can Transform the Classroom Just Like the Calculator
AI can better education, not threaten it, if we learn some lessons from the adoption of the calculator into the classroom

The rapidly expanding use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools has fired up a fervent debate in academia. On one side of the debate, professors and teachers are concerned over the future of postsecondary learning and threats to traditional disciplines, especially within the humanities, as headlines warn of âThe End of the English Major.â
Nevertheless, AI is here and about a third of teachers, from kindergarten through high school, report using it in the classroom, according to a recent survey. While many of our colleagues in higher education policy, science policy, and university design criticize or dismiss generative AI, we are instead decidedly optimistic it will follow a pattern seen in other technologies that have enhanced educational access and success. We believe that when new technologies are embraced, core aspects of learning, including curriculum, instruction and assessment, can be revolutionized. We are optimistic about AI, but we donât see it as a hero. Students and instructors are still the heroes of human learning, even when AI is involved.
History supports this view. From the Gutenberg press to online math classes, technologies that improve access to quality learning opportunities are routinely dismissed by critics and skeptics, especially by those who hold the reins in the classroom.

Consider the calculator. A survey in the mid-1970s carried out by Mathematics Teacher magazine found that 72 percent of respondentsâmainly teachers and mathematiciansâopposed equipping seventh graders with calculators. Highlighted in 1975 in Science News, this survey mirrored the broader discourse of the Sesame Street era concerning the introduction of calculators into classrooms, just when costs were approaching the point that some schools could afford to have up to one calculator per student.
Calculators met resistance from educators who feared an overdependence on technology would erode studentsâ math skills. As one professor observed of students and calculators, âI have yet to be convinced that handing them a machine and teaching them how to push the button is the right approach. What do they do when the battery runs out?â
It is easy to see how the case of the calculator mirrors current concerns about generative AI. The College Board made a similar argument in an article published last spring that mused about the âGreat Calculator Panic of the 1980s and â90s.â Critics of AI in the classroom argue that students might never learn to writeor respond to written prompts independently if they can simply ask an AI to do it for them. The hypothetical scenario where the Internet or servers are down raises fears that students would be unable to write a simple sentence or compose a basic five-paragraph essay.
Narrow arguments over essay integrity and potential declines in learning quality miss the broader perspective on how this technology could positively reshape curriculum, instruction and assessment.
In classrooms, technology, curriculum, instruction, and assessment evolve together to reshape education. We see this historically with calculators and are now witnessing it unfold in real time with the emergence of generative AI tools.
The introduction of calculators into classrooms didn't set in motion the demise of mathematics education; instead, it significantly broadened its scope while inspiring educators and academics to rethink the educational limits of mathematics. This shift fostered a climate ripe for innovation. Looking at todayâs math landscape and what existed in the 1970s, we would be hard-pressed to consider the past superior to the present, to say nothing of the future. Today, high school students use (and more importantly, comprehend) graphing calculators and computers better than undergraduate engineering students in university labs could only a generation ago. Todayâs math learning environment is observably more dynamic, inclusive and creative than it was before ubiquitous access to calculators.
In a parallel vein, generative AI promises to extend this kind of innovation in critical thinking and the humanities, making it easier for students to grasp foundational concepts and explore advanced topics with confidence. AI could allow for customized learner supportâadapting to the individual pace and learning style of each student, helping to make education more inclusive and tailored to specific needs. Generative AI can better the humanities by making reading and writing more accessible to diverse students, including those with learning disabilities or challenges with traditional writing methods.
Just as calculators led us to reevaluate legacy teaching methods and embrace more effective pedagogical approaches, generative AI calls for a similar transformation in how we approach assignments, conduct classes and assess learning. It will shift us from viewing the college essay as the pinnacle of learning to embracing wider creative and analytical exercises, ones facilitated by AI tools.
The successful integration of calculators into math education serves as a blueprint for the adoption of generative AI across the curriculum. By designing assignments with the expectation that generative AI will enhance rather than shortcut them, educators can foster learning that values creativity, critical thinking and efficient study. This shift necessitates a broader, more adaptable approach to teaching and learning, one that recognizes the potential of technology to elevate educational standards and broaden access to knowledge.
This history points to broader questions over the efficiency and fairness of long-standing educational mechanisms. Take, for example, college admissions essays, which are known to perpetuate bias in university admissions. What if AI allowed us to reconceptualize the tools for students to demonstrate their aptitude and college preparedness? What if AI could allow students to match their intended college major more accurately to the most supportive and corresponding place of higher learning? In academia, we shouldnât focus solely on AIâs potential for misuse but also on its capability to revolutionize curricula and approaches to learning and teaching.
Far from fearing technological progress, history teaches us to embrace it to broaden and democratize learning. The greater challenge lies not in resisting change, but in leveraging these innovations to develop curricula that address the needs of all learners, paving the way for a more equal and effective education for everyone. Looking ahead, generative AI is not so much a problem to be solved, but instead a powerful ally in our efforts to make education meaningfully universal.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:56:07,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/lauren-perez-waltzer-anablue-hair-beauty-routine/,"Lauren Perez Waltzer, Founder, Anablue",2184,"âIâve been surrounded by fashion my whole life. My parents are in the industry, and I would go to showrooms with them growing up. My uncle started a big brand in the â80s called Rampage. I remember being in the warehouse and going monkey bar to monkey bar with the clothing racks. I naturally thought thatâs what I wanted to do myself. Luckily, I was able to work in the family business, which dealt with wholesale fashion, but as I grew up, I realized I wanted something different for myself. I knew I didn't necessarily want to be a designer but I still wanted to be in that realm, so I started my consultancy firm, Here Four You. I do everything from creative direction to marketing and brand strategy. When people ask, âWhat do you do?â I always make a joke and say, âWhatever you need me to do. That's why itâs called Here Four You.â Alo Yoga was one of my first clients. I launched the first store 10 years ago with the founders, Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge. Other clients include Bandier, Good American, FRAME, and Khy, Kylie Jennerâs fashion brand.
Working with all of these brands has been so helpful in taking my own hair company, Anablue, from bottle to market. Iâve really seen the level of detail needed to scale a company. In a way, Iâve been training for this my whole life. I grew up making my own hair concoctions with oils my dad gotten from Morocco. Meanwhile, my mom and I spent Saturdays making scrubs and lotions in our kitchen, and now, all three productsâthe Treatment Oil, the Scalp Cleanser, and the Hair Serumâare a direct result of those experiments.
SKINCARE
When you become pregnant, you have to take a look at every ingredient in your products because there are a lot you canât use. You also get new skin conditionsâI had melasma with my first pregnancy, and Iâm dealing with it again now that Iâm pregnant with my baby girl. I know there are all of these lasers to help, but last time, the melasma spots faded on their own, so Iâm hoping thatâs the case this time, too.
I pretty much always have the same skincare products on my shelves. I love the Image Ormedic Balancing Facial Cleanser. It soaps but itâs not foamy and it makes me feel really clean. SkinCeuticalsâs C E Ferulic was one of the first products that I learned about when I was building a more âadultâ skincare routine, and Iâve loved it ever since. It makes me very glowy. Itâs definitely expensive, but it lasts.
You know how the dad in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' uses Windex for everything? AvÃ¨neâs Cicalfate Restorative Skin Cream is my Windex. If I have a zit, I put it on. If I pick at a blemish, I put it on. Scar? Burn? Put it on. I donât even really know what itâs actually for. I have just used it my whole life. Weledaâs Skin Food Cream has been more of a ârecentâ discovery for meâI like to wear it overnight. Itâs funny because when I told my friends about it, they were like, âOh. I use that all the time.â I was like, âWhy didn't you tell me!?â

Rhodeâs Glazing Milk is the one product I definitely use if I know Iâm going to put on makeup because it gives you this really smooth base. Itâs also really great when youâre traveling because itâs so hydrating. And then Iâm in love with everything from OSEA. I always have their Hand Cream by the side of my bed. I keep one in my purse, too. Itâs really the best. The Undaria Algae Body Oil is especially great because it absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. Iâve tried other oils that made me feel sticky for hours, but I put OSEAâs oil on right as I get out of the shower when my skin is still moist and then I can put on clothes within five minutes. Since Iâm pregnant, Iâve been adding an extra layer of moisture with the TYBalm. Itâs made by my friend Tyson Solomon. Itâs so good and made with all organic and vegan ingredients.
And then Iâve tried a lot of different sunscreens, but the one that I love the most is Acureâs Radically Rejuvenating SPF Day Creamâitâs not sticky at all and goes on super smoothly. For my body, I like AvÃ¨neâs Mineral Body Lotion SPF 50.
MAKEUP
The goal with my makeup is always to enhance what I have and to look like Iâm glowing and have my shit together. My features are pretty dark and I have a lot of freckles, so the second I put on too much product, I feel like Iâm just painting over my face and I hate it.
I do have melasma patches that need some coverage, but I try to be as light-handed as possible. I love the Kylie Power Plush Concealer in 3N and 4W. It gives you full coverage without having to use a lot of it. I always dot a little under my eyes with my fingers and buff it out with a Kylie Concealer Brush. I donât like beauty sponges. They absorb too much product, and no matter how hard I try, I can never get them fully clean. If you think about it, itâs kind of gross. Theyâre also not cheap.
Chanelâs Les Beiges Bronzing Cream is a fan-favorite for a reason. The formula is super dewy and really melts into your skin without feeling heavy. Itâs so good. I love to use shade Soleil Tan Bronze on my eyes actually. I donât love when my eyes look too dark or too shimmery, but I do put a bit of the Chanel Multi-Use Glow Stick in Sculpting or DragÃ©e on top of the bronzer. My eyes are naturally really big, and I feel like this combination opens them up even more. I fluctuate a lot with mascara, but Maybellineâs Great Lash is amazing.

I also love everything from Charlotte Tilbury, but especially her Cheek To Chic Blushes. I like to put Pillow Talk Original on my nose and my cheekbones and blend it up, kind of into my forehead. I love that the color is not too pink. It looks really natural on me. In the summer, I might add a second blush for intensity. Kylieâs Pressed Blush Powder in Winter Kisses is great. Itâs easy to carry and really lasts. If Iâm walking into a room and feel like I need to have a little something on my face, Iâll dab on some of the powder. Oh, and I also put a little bit of the Chanel Glow Stick on my nose and blend them together for a shimmery pink look.
Charlotte Tilburyâs Lip Cheat Lip Liner in Pillow Talk is a bit darker than the natural color of my lips, so it really helps create the illusion that my lips are a little bigger than they actually are. It also lasts forever without bleeding or getting stickyâmakeup artist Mary Phillips taught me how to line them. And then I love all of Rhodeâs Peptide Lip Tints, but I especially gravitate towards Toast and Espresso. The formula isnât sticky at all. Iâm constantly reapplying it because I love the way it feels on my lips. And I always have the original Peptide Lip Treatment in my purse. Itâs so hydrating and lightâIâve put my husband on it. Iâve put my brothers on it. Itâs amazing.
HAIR 
I treat my hair the same way most people treat their face. The hair industry is all about repair, but Iâm all about prevention. To that end, Iâve never dyed my hair. Growing up, it was instilled in me that my hair is tied to where I come from, my family, and my Moroccan culture. My dad would have killed me if I had dyed it or fully cut it off. My mom is also Moroccan but sheâs blonde, and she would always tell me, âYou have the most beautiful color. Never touch it.â
I get a haircut every six weeks. My hair grows pretty quickly, but Iâm also a big advocate of getting regular cuts; I think itâs the only way to prevent split ends. People are so scared to cut itâand I get itâbut they donât realize that trimming it wonât change anything besides giving them healthy hair. I have this beautiful stylist, Rita Gili, come to my house. She was actually my husbandâs stylist first, but she really understands my hair.

Prior to founding Anablue, I was constantly trying to find the best products on the market that were âclean.â When I began formulating my line, I wanted to start off with the perfect three-step routine that covers your basic necessities. All of the products have argan oil, which helps with hair hydration and scalp health. I always start my routine by putting the Treatment Oil on my scalp all the way to my ends. Sometimes I leave it overnightâor longerâand rinse it out in the morning, but you can leave it in as little as 30 minutes. Then I use the Scalp Cleanser to wash out the oil. It gently exfoliates your scalp to encourage new hair growth. Our scalp truly is like our skin; if you donât exfoliate it, youâre going to have dead skin and clogged pores. I recommend using the Cleanser once a week but no more than twice. I donât love using my fingers to wash my hair honestly; I just feel like I can never get every part of my head with my hands. I really love my Scalp Massager. Massagers in general are great for simulating blood flow in your scalp, which promotes hair growth. I use it all of the time, both on dry and wet hair. And I donât use conditioner after since the argan in the Treatment Oil acts as a natural conditioner.
Your hair is so fragile when itâs wet, so I use a Reverie Good Detangling Hair Brush, which has the same prongs as my scalp massager. It doesnât pull my hair at all. That said, I never really use it on wet hair. Since my hair is wavy, I want it to settle into its natural pattern. If it gets knotty, I add in our Hair Serum to smooth it out. You can really have fun and use it anytime you want. And it doesnât have silicone, which makes me very proud.

If Iâm styling it or need to put my hair up, I love Emi Jayâs Big Effing Clips and Slipâs Skinny Silk Scrunchiesâsilk-anything is better for your hair overall. I also have Slip Silk Pillowcases to prevent dryness and even fallout. Theyâre a great little addition to your hair care routine.
NAILS
I donât have time to get my nails done once a week and I canât stand showing up somewhere with my nails undone, so the easiest thing is to get a gel manicure every couple of weeks. Iâve been going to Long Tran at Nature Nails for 10 years. Heâs traveled from salon to salon, and Iâve followed him everywhere. I wear a pair of UV protection gloves when I see him. I have them cut really short right now. Actually, itâs so funny because Long made fun of me when I cut my nails. I had the longest and pointiest nails when I had [my son] Snow, but then I had this âahaâ moment where I realized, âWait, this is kind of gross.â Like, washing dishes felt wrong with long nails all of a sudden. I was also worried that I was going to poke him in the eye. Long now looks at me and goes, âYouâve changed ever since you had your baby.â
FRAGRANCE
I donât really use perfumes. I didnât grow up seeing my mom use them so they never became a part of my daily routine. But I love the smell of flowers in my homeâespecially gardenias. I want people to feel like theyâre walking through a gardenâmaybe with undertones of citrusâwhen they visit me. Diptyque makes beautiful floral-scented candles that arenât so intense. Roses is a classic. Itâs also a great gift. The same goes for Flamingo Estateâs Night Blooming Jasmine & Damask Rose Candle. Itâs floral but refreshing at the same time.â

Low-Earth Orbit Faces a Spiraling Debris Threat
Millions of human-made objects travel at high speeds in low-Earth orbit, polluting space and increasing the chance of collision with satellites and other spacecraft
By Aneli Bongers & JosÃ© L. Torres

Space is getting crowded, with junk. Essential satellites delivering navigation, weather forecasts, the Internet and other services face this threat daily. Old rockets, decaying spacecraft and human operations in space leave behind orbital debris that increasingly threatens collisions, menacing a growing space economy. A decade ago the film Gravity dramatized the consequences of space pollution, with an avalanche of space junk sweeping across the sky to batter everything in orbit, including its astronaut hero. We havenât done anything serious about it since then.
NASA defines space junk, or orbital debris, as âany human-made object in orbit that no longer serves a useful purpose, including spacecraft fragments and retired satellites.â A 2009 incident, when the U.S. communications satellite Iridium 33 collided with the defunct Russian military satellite Kosmos 2251, serves as a good reminder of its growing threat. That single collision created more than 2,200 pieces of new debris measuring over five centimeters in diameters, according to NASA.
More of these collisions are coming. In February an abandoned Russian satellite passed within about 20 meters of a NASA satellite. SpaceXâs Starlink satellite constellation alone carried out more than 25,000 collision-avoidance maneuvers from December 2022 to May 2023. And even on Earth, space junk is a problem, with a Florida home struck in March by a battery that fell from an International Space Station cargo mission.

In space, debris comes from the frequent breakup of expended rocket bodies, explosion of satellites, dead satellites, collisions, paint flakes and even tools lost by astronauts. Around 85 percent of this debris resides within low-Earth orbit, which is below 2,000 kilometers in altitude. NASA estimates this orbit contains around 34,000 pieces of debris larger than 10 cm in diameter, 900,000 objects between 1 cm and 10 cm, and more than 128 million fragments between 1 mm and 1 cm. But letâs not be fooled by the size. Even small debris traveling at high velocities can trigger catastrophic collisions, with the added problem that fragments smaller than 10 cm are impossible to track with existing surveillance technology. An even more dangerous threat is self-propagation. Called the âKessler syndrome,â this phenomenon occurs when collisions produce so much debris that Earthâs orbit becomes unusable for any human activity.
We must stop the growth of space debris, while realizing it is a demanding task. Neither national governments nor international organizations control property rights on orbit, apart from spacecraft ownership. Therefore, space activities are not subject to any centralized regulation or property rights scheme. In outer space âfirst come, first serveâ instead applies. Like other global economic failures on Earth (such as fisheries in international waters, high seas sailing and climate change) that international cooperation has failed to solve or left only partly solved, overuse and depletion are direct consequences of such a âtragedy of the commons.â
In all these cases, including orbital debris, pollution exerts a cost on society where market prices do not capture the impact. Such âexternalitiesâ are market failures that, in most cases, require intervention from a government or other central authority. Simply put, rocket launch prices donât reflect their real costs, which include clean-up expenses. We must reverse this situation before the cost becomes too high. Although human exploration and economic exploitation of outer space are relatively recent (the first human-made spacecraft, Sputnik, successfully launched in 1957), evident market failures and other economic, legal and political issues are arising at rocket speed as commercial, military and scientific activities in outer space expand. SpaceX is now developing a massive rocket that will launch 1.25-ton satellites like a Pez dispenser, adding to a fleet of 5,500 Starlink satellites already in space, part of a planned constellation of 42,000. Thatâs particularly alarming, because, according to a study of ours published last year in Ecological Economics, low-Earth orbit can only hold about 72,000 satellites without a real risk of a Kessler syndrome event, under current debris conditions.
LEO stands for low Earth orbit and is the region of space within 2,000 km of the Earth's surface. It is the most concentrated area for orbital debris, represented with white dots and scaled to optimize visibility.
NASA/ODPO
No surprise, spacefaring nations that are most dependent on satellites face the biggest risks of space debris. Instead of cooperating to mitigate space debris, however, they have failed to take decisive action. Thatâs despite the increasing probability of losing satellites, resulting in more resources that must be dedicated to debris surveillance tracking and collision-avoidance maneuvers that interrupt services and burn fuel. That, in turn, reduces the operational life of satellites, adding to their costs as the threat burgeons. Nonetheless, spacefaring companies have no incentive to minimize debris generation except for protecting their own spacecraft, which they do with shields.
We need to take both passive and active measures before space junk gets out of control. Space agencies and the United Nations have elaborated guidelines for debris mitigation. Some include changing the design of satellites with shields and reinforcing fuel systems to avoid breakups. Another recommends that all spacefarers provide spacecraft with maneuverability and add reserve fuel to de-orbit derelict spacecraft.
On the active measures side, developing debris-free recovery launch vehicles will greatly help to eliminate the primary source of debris. But there are still other sources, and given current orbiting derelict stock, active depolluting actions are also necessary. Thatâs because the life spans of orbital debris vary depending on altitude. Below 200 kilometers, it may only last a few days, whereas those at 1,000 km can last up to a thousand years. At 2,000 km, the debris can remain in orbit for up to 50,000 years without human intervention.
Cleaning space requires designing and implementing active debris removal (ADR) projects. ADR vehicles can be equipped with robotic arms, nets, collecting balloons and other tools. Earth-based lasers might also increase the atmospheric drag of debris, as another option. Policy makers must explore financing the cost of removal policies with instruments already in place for mitigating pollution on Earth. They should also develop guidelines and regulations to share the space junk removal cost among all spacefaring agents.
Finally, there is also a more alarming problem to pay attention to: the militaryâs use of space. Space pollution results not only from commercial and scientific activities, but also because of outer spaceâs growing strategic value for defense, security and warfare. Hard as it is to understand, Earth's orbit has been polluted not only accidentally but also intentionally, as some countries have conducted antisatellite tests using missiles that destroyed their own satellites. The last one, performed by Russia in 2021, created a vast cloud of hundreds of thousands of fragments, dramatically increasing orbital debris at the most congested and polluted altitudes.
The militarization and weaponization of outer space contribute to orbital debris while acting as a roadblock to the de-pollution of space. Development of debris removal vehicles and devices is hindered by their dual-use status as antisatellite weapons, a significant obstacle to implementing international policies for eliminating orbital pollution. Any ADR technology could also be viewed as an offensive weapon, as it could remove enemy satellites from orbit. For the same reason, the militarization of outer space could threaten the development of new in-space industries for the servicing, refueling, upgrading, maintenance and repair of satellites. Humanity instead needs a clean, safe and regulated space environment to build a better world on Earth.

She is also an RYT-200 yoga teacher and NASM CPT personal trainer.
Ms. Feller owns Maya Feller Nutrition, where her team focuses on the provision of culturally responsive medical nutrition therapy for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mood disorders, and disordered eating. She is author of Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites from Cultures Around the World (goop Press), and Co-Host of Well, Now Podcast, Slateâs new wellness podcast.
Semaglutide or GLP-1 medicationsâlike Ozempic and Wegovyâare all the rage in the weight loss community these days.
Not only are people all over social media touting the weight loss benefits, prescriptions for diabetes drugs and similar obesity medication may be up as much as 300 percent over the last few years, according to one report.
As for what to eat while on semaglutide, well, we just released a GLP-1 Nutrition Plan in the MyFitnessPal app dedicated just to that. But because the medication can make you feel fuller faster, youâll likely eat smaller portions, which means you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of nutrition. Thatâs why many experts recommend eating a well-balanced diet for the best results.
But what exactly does that mean? While thereâs no one-size-fits-all answer, there are some general guidelines on what to eat while on Ozempic or any other semaglutide medications.
We spoke with registered dietitian and MyFitnessPal Scientific Advisor Maya Feller , MS, RD, CDN who shared some of the foods that may be most helpful.
1. Bone broth
Bone broth pulls double duty as both a protein source and a hydration source. DrFeller recommends drinking 8 ounces a day as part of your daily liquid intake.
Because bone broth contains electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, it may help keep you hydrated better than plain water, one study shows.
2. Dates
âI really believe people who enjoy sweets should have them, in a mindful and intentional way, if they want toâ Feller says. âIt makes us all happier.â
To satisfy that sugary craving, she recommends dates. Theyâre a good source of fiber high in fiber and may not spike your blood sugar as much as other dried fruits, when consumed in moderation. .
One thing to note: If youâre dealing with early satiety, Feller advises limiting how many dates youâre snacking on at a time. âPotein is very important,â she explains, âso donât fill up on dates and miss out on that important macronutrient.â
3. Tofu
Protein is an essential macronutrient for everyone, including those who are on semaglutide. Dr. Feller is a big fan of plant protein in particular, pointing out that most Americans arenât eating nearly enough plants on a day-to-day basis.
She likes tofu as a healthy plant-based protein source. According to the USDA, a half-cup serving of tofu has about 22 grams of protein.
Along with all of the benefits of proteinâlike better bone health and appetite regulationâtofu has also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and help lower cholesterol.

4. Seafood
Not only is seafood another good source of lean protein, it also contains polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Studies have shown these PUFAs to have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help prevent health conditions like arthritis and cardiovascular disease. They can also support immune healthÂ  and lower blood pressure.
As for what specific seafood is best? Dr. Feller says whatever is accessible and affordable will do, whether thatâs shrimp, salmon, or any other kind of fish. The key is to choose seafood that is as close to its unadulterated form as possible, with minimal added sugar, salt, or fat.
5. Summer Squash and cucumbers
Staying hydrated while on semaglutide medications is important. And while drinking water is an easy way to do that, you can also rehydrate by eating certain foods.
Dr. Feller suggests adding more vegetables with a high water contentâlike cucumbers, zucchini, and other summer squashesâinto your diet. Not only will these provide you with more fluid to help with digestion, they also have some nutritional value. Win-win.
6. Cruciferous vegetables
Dr. Feller likes cruciferous veggies like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, or Brussels sprouts primarily for the gut health benefits. They contain certain compounds that can promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria and balance your microbiome. Some research has shown this may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, too.
Theyâre also high in fiber, which can help improve digestion and keep you regular. This is especially important when youâre taking Ozempic, which slows your digestive system and increases how long it takes food and waste to exit your body.

Glycineâa single compound found in foodsâis taking TikTok by storm.
The compound has been on the rise for a while, but recently went viral on social media thanks to an infomercial targeted towards âglycine girlies,â a niche group of young women obsessed with the up-and-coming supplement. But itâs sparked a conversation, with plenty of people wondering what exactly it isâand whether or not itâs worth taking.
To help answer those questions, we spoke with one of our registered dietitians Katherine Basbaum to dig into the science.
Glycine is one of the amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein in your body. âIt is considered a non-essential amino acid since the body can produce glycine, as opposed to essential amino acids, which can only be obtained from dietary sources,â Basbaum explains.
That said, the amount of glycine your body produces often isnât enough to meet your daily needs. While you can buy glycine supplements, the amino acid is also naturally found in protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish and legumes.
âGlycineâs main function is to help promote the growth and health of cells in the body,â Basbaum explains. However, research has shown there may be additional benefits to consuming the amino acid, which include:
How much glycine do you need for these benefits? Well, thereâs no official Dietary Reference Intake for it (or any of the non-essential amino acids, for that matter). However, some studies suggest an intake of 1.5 to 3 grams per day. Basbaum says the average adult currently consumes about 2 grams per day.

If you want to up your glycine intake, Basbaum recommends prioritizing protein in your diet. âA good way to ensure adequate amino acid intake is through dietary protein such as meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy, soy products, beans and legumes,â she says. You can track your protein intake through the MyFitnessPal app to get a good idea of your current consumption level.
And as for those trendy glycine supplements you might see all over TikTok, Basbaum advises against them for now. Instead, stick to real food. âNot only can you typically get all the nutrients your body needs through a balanced diet, but it is often a safer bet as dietary supplements are not regulated as rigorously by the FDA,â she cautions.

Fashion,2024-05-04,19:55:57,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/elizabeth-grace-hand-stalle-studios-jon-folkesson-skincare/,Dating The Skincare Addict,1896,"Elizabeth Grace Hand, the aesthetician and founder of New York facial studio StÃ¤lle Studiosâa favorite of clients like influencer Alix Earle and gallerist Hannah Traore for its bespoke, treatment-focused approachâmet her partner, Jon Folkesson, in 2019. It was Valentineâs Day and Hand had all but given up on dating. âI was 29, I had been dating in the city since I moved here for college at 19, and it was douchebag after douchebag after douchebag,â she says. âI was exhausted, but I liked my job and I liked my friends, so I thought, âI like cats. Iâll be a cat lady.â I was really happy with that.â Then her roommate introduced her to Jon, and five years later, the couple lives together with their cat, Muesli Pettifleur. But this Valentineâs Day, weâre focusing on more than just their love story (though, of course, we made sure to ask about that, too.) In the half decade that heâs known Elizabeth, Jonâs skincare routine has gone from one face cream he haphazardly picked up at AÄsop, to two very serious morning and night routines, and a few injectables thrown into the mix. It all started at The Bowery Hotel, with a glass of sparkling water and a $1,200 charge from Dr. Barbara Sturm. Elizabeth and Jon explain below.
Jon Folkesson:
When I met Elizabeth, I was six months into living in New YorkâI had moved from Stockholm, where I lived my entire life. I had met her roommate, Frans, through other Swedes in the city. It was my first Valentineâs Day in the US, and I went over to their apartment. Elizabeth came in and sat on the couch. She was drinking a can of Recess.
Elizabeth Grace Hand:
I was working for Dr. Barbara Sturm as a sales rep at the time. I had just come back from a long day at work. I was having some friends over for hors dâoeuvres before they went to dinner across the street at Rosieâs in the East Village.
JF:
She wasâisâa beautiful girl, so I started chatting her up.
EGH:
I could tell that he was into me, but I was so anti-dating at that point that I didnât really see him. I mean, we talked and he was really sweet, but I was like, âOh. Itâs just another one of Fransâs weird friends.â
JF:
The next day, Frans sent me a selfie from her Instagram.
EGH:
Frans inviting Jon over wasnât a setup, but we later learned that he realized weâd be a good match when we were at the apartment.
JF:
I asked Frans to give me her number and if she had said anything about me. He said, âYeah. She said that youâre very Swedish.â
EGH:
So Jon texted me, âHey, Elizabeth. This is Jon, Fransâs very Swedish friend.â
JF:
Thatâs one of the best texts Iâve ever sent. I asked her to get drinks at Altro Paradiso. Her response wasnât super friendly, but she said yes.
EGH: 
I remember telling a girl at work, âUgh. What a douchebag. He wants to go to a restaurant on the west side. He knows I live on the east side.â Thatâs how fucked up I was in the head. I was in a major âI hate menâ phase.
JF:
The obvious reason was that I lived in the West Village and I had been to the East Village maybe once since I moved to New York. I didnât know shit over there.
EGH:
I suggested The Bowery Hotel instead.
JF:
She had a glass of water on our date.
EGH:
It was sparkling. It was the first time I was dating in my era of deciding I was a cat lady. I was going to be fully me. I had no agenda. I didnât go into it thinking he would be my partner.
JF:
But I enjoyed her company a lot. I left happy.

EGH: 
Of course, we talked about what we did for work. He told me his office was on Lexington and 52nd, so after a couple of days passed and he hadnât texted me, I was like, âFuck it. Iâll be the one to text him.â I said, âIâm going to be nearby at Barneys doing a Sturm training. You should come. I can help you with your skincare routine.â He didnât have a routine, and also, I thought to myself, âWell, if I can at least get a sale out of himâ¦â
JF:
At that point, I knew nothing about skincare. The only product I owned was a face cream from AÄsop. I didnât even know cleansers existed. But I was really happy that she texted me because it was a sign that she wanted to see me. I showed up at Barneys, where Iâd never been before, and I wanted to support her because she was working. I asked her what she thought I needed, and she started picking one thing after another.
I walked out with two different cleansers, two different serums, and I think, two different creams. I didnât ask how much the products cost because I didnât want to be that guy. I just handed her my credit card and didnât look at the receipt until I left, but I got a fucking shock when I did. It was $1,200. I was like, âMaybe this is what people do here.â
EGH:
After that, I was like, âSo what are you doing this weekend?â [Laughs]

JF:
My routine looks very different now. First of all, I probably am the most spoiled partner in terms of skincare. Iâve been a guinea pig for her, and I do what she tells me to do.
EGH:
Maintenance and prevention is really the goal with him. Itâs winter in New York and heâs doing infrared saunas and cold plunges. He does a lot of sweaty workouts, too. He can get a little dry, red, and clogged in the T-zone.
JF:
In the mornings, I need my routine to be quick. I hydrate with lemon water, do ten minutes of yoga, take a shower, and put on my products. I start off with the RetrouvÃ© Conditioning Tonic, which is by far the best essence Iâve ever used.
EGH:
Itâs also really good if he shaves too because it has chamomile. Itâs so calming.
JF:
I recently started using Chanelâs La Solution 10 De Chanel. It doesnât have a scent, and it lasts on your skin. Then I put on my sunscreen, Auteurâs Definitive Sun Drops SPF 50, which is not something that I would use unless I were with an aesthetician. Before I met Elizabeth, the only time Iâd wear sunscreen was on vacation.
EGH:
At night, he starts off with the RetrouvÃ© Luminous Cleansing Elixir.
JF:
Itâs really good. I hate when it takes too long to get a cleanser off your face. I want to put water on my face twice at most. Having to splash water on your face ten times is so annoying. After my cleanser, I apply the BioEffect 30 Day Treatment.
EGH:
Itâs a growth factor serum made from barley. It helps promote collagen production in the skin. The 30 Day Treatment comes with three dropper bottles that last most people between six to eight weeks. When one runs out, you go to the next one. Theyâre separated into three vials to keep the formula really stable.
JFG:
Then I use the RetrouvÃ© Intensive Replenishing Facial Moisturizer. I love this one. I donât want to oversell anything, but RetrouvÃ© is a game-changer. I only use one pump, and it still works for my dry skin. I carry it down to my neck and chest. Then itâs time for my RetrouvÃ© Eye Concentrate. It feels very thick and nourishing.
EGH:
Apply it with your ring finger for the perfect amount of pressure.

JF:
Face oils seemed too greasy to me, but the RetrouvÃ© Balancing Face Oil is not at all sticky. It feels great. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is really soft and dewy.
EGH:
During the week, we sprinkle in different steps.
JF:
Like exfoliation, which kind of takes a higher level of education. [Laughs]
EGH:
Iâll have him use the Sachi Ursolic Acid & Retinal Overnight Reform one or two times a week at night. Otherwise, I have him use something with an enzyme, like the Auteur Definitive Enzyme Cleanser, or some sort of acid, like the Sachi Complexion Clarifying Accelerator. The Sachi Accelerator has mandelic acid, which is really good for people that are more fair. It also has Manuka honey, which is really nice. The RetrouvÃ© Skin Brilliance Priming Pads are nice for the winter especially because they use lactic acid. Theyâre also very juicy so you have enough product to run them through your hands, too.
JF:
And I have two favorite masks, the Augustinus Bader Face Cream Mask and the Biologique Recherche Creme Masque Vernixânot the Masque Vivant; that one smells disgusting. I call the Vernix the banana mask because it smells like a ripe banana. It makes your skin so soft. If Iâm in a hurry and I want to go to bed, I could just do a mask instead of my night routine. I have phases with them. Sometimes I use one every three days, but right now, Iâm using one once a week.

When it comes to treatments, Iâve done Botox once at Plump with Amy Lee. Elizabeth was getting filler, and I sat in the room with her. During the treatment, Amy said, âYou should get Botox.â I feel like Elizabeth and Amy probably talked about it before I went in. [Laughs] Elizabeth had tried to convince me before and I said no because I didnât want to have something that I needed to spend $1,000 on every couple of months, but I got a little bit of Botox around my angry elevens and around my eyes. After a week, I went back for a touch-up and got more. After it settled, my wrinkles were completely gone. Itâs actually really cool, what Botox does to you. I would get it again. Why not?
Overall, Iâm happy that I have a routine that makes me feel fresh and clean. Iâve always been into health, even though I had my phases where I partied. Now, I donât drink, I exercise, I try to eat very clean. I see skincare as a part of the lifestyle of trying to care for myself. But for any men reading this: Your routine doesnât have to be complicatedâI just have the luxury of having Elizabeth and a lot of products at home. Everyone wants to feel like they are their best self. Skincare helps.

Online Age Verification Laws Could Do More Harm Than Good
More U.S. states are requiring online ID checks. A proposed French strategy aims to balance child safety with usersâ privacy rights
By Lauren Leffer

Itâs getting a little more onerous to access online pornography. Within the past few weeks, Kansas, Florida and Idaho became the latest U.S. states to pass policies requiring âadultâ websites to verify visitorsâ age before allowing access. Five other states already had similar statutes, and lawmakers have introduced or are considering them in many more. Across the Atlantic, the European Union has imposed age-verification requirements on three of the worldâs largest pornography sites. France, Germany and the U.K. also recently ordered all such sites to verify that users are aged 18 or older.
Supporters say that the intent of these laws is to prevent children and teenagers from viewing explicit and potentially harmful content. But age-verification requirements have drawn many critics, from the American Civil Liberties Union to Pornhub to online privacy experts. Detractors note that such laws endanger adultsâ digital anonymity and put personal data at risk.
Currently the most widely adopted methods of digital age verification involve users sharing sensitive information such as facial scans, official ID cards or banking particulars with third-party companiesâdetails which, in the process, inevitably get linked to individual data on pornography consumption. This poses obvious opportunities for hacking, theft and extortion, argue digital rights advocacy groups, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

Yet there is at least one other approach. Olivier Blazy, a computer scientist and professor at the Ãcole Polytechnique in France, worked with the countryâs National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) to design a more private system of online age verification in 2022. This method, which has been under evaluation and testing in France since 2023, adds a digital intermediary between a restricted website and an age-verification service. The system prevents the website from âseeingâ information that could identify a user. Meanwhile the third-party age verifier cannot detect which site a user is visiting. âThere are still privacy risks,â Blazy saysâbut âitâs not worseâ than the baseline risk all Internet users accept when they go online from personal computers. Scientific American spoke with Blazy to learn more about the problems of online age verification and how they might be fixed.
[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]
What are the privacy concerns surrounding online age-verification laws?
The privacy concerns come from questions of âWhat kind of data do you collect to do this age verification? And what are you going to do with them?â The worst example would be if you directly collected peopleâs name and the type of website theyâre trying to access. Then someone could establish a list of who follows certain contentâwhich could be used to target groups such as LGBTQ+ people. That would be terrible.
In France recently there have been many big hacks of government websites. The last one targeted the [government] unemployment website, and it affected 43 million people. We know that establishing lists is a very bad idea.
What are the most common strategies suggested for age verification? What vulnerabilities do they have?
One of the solutions people like to imagine is scanning an ID cardâthough weâve already seen hacks that try to access identity documents. If this happens, it will probably be an easy target for hackers. And itâs easy to trick these systems. I managed to access a website by downloading a picture of an ID card I found on the Internet.
Thereâs also facial recognitionâthat leads to biometric data being stored. Biometric data are also super sensitive, and if this kind of information is leaked, itâs dangerous. From a hackerâs point of view, a database of biometric data is like a big piÃ±ata that you want to break open because that information provides easy access to do [harmful] things. There is also a lot of bias with facial recognition. Itâs often very bad at estimating the age of women, especially if they are wearing makeup, and people of color.
Something that was classically done on adult websites was to ask users to perform a payment of $0 or Â£0 just to prove that you have an account that is set up to pay over the Internet. The idea is that these kinds of accounts are only for adults, but thatâs no longer true. Some banks allow these kinds of payments and accounts from people younger than 18. Plus, this is bad because you are telling people to input banking information on a website that is not necessarily super secure. One can also imagine fake porn sites with fake portals that lure people to enter banking information.
What is the alternative strategy you helped develop?
We created an [automated program interface to exist as a firewall] between the content provider and the verification service.... The only information the content provider gets is a yes or no about whether a user is [aged 18 or older]. The only information the age verifier gets is that someone has sent an age-verification request.
In France people already have a digital identity through this portal called FranceConnect. Everybody with a French social security number has an account there. Itâs what you use to pay your taxes. Itâs not the kind of account youâre going to give away to someone else. We didnât work with it directly, but we did try to devise a system that would be compatible with this and still prevent the government from knowing what kind of websites people access.
Our system is run by the user in a browser on their computer or smartphone. Itâs not going to interact with an external server. When a user tries to access a website, the website sends them a challenge, and the user takes that challenge to whatever existing age-verification provider they want to use. The provider gives some kind of digital signature that assures that the user is [aged 18 or older]. The user can then forward that signature to the website.
Are there still privacy risks associated with this protocol?
There are still privacy risks in that sense that any time you use the Internet without a VPN [virtual private network], websites have access to your IP address, so youâre not anonymous. But what we did is prove that [our system is as secure as] this.
VPNs are often used to bypass age verification or other restrictions. Do these tools make verification laws ineffective?
If you ask me, Iâm against these laws. I donât think theyâre super effective. I think teenagers are smart enough to be able to install VPNs.
If you want to defend these kinds of laws, I [do] think it might prevent some young children from accidentally accessing adult content. Maybe young children wonât think about installing a VPN to purposefully go to such websites. It might raise the age of first [pornography] access, which I think is a good thing, but it will not be efficient. Thinking about the cost of implementing these kinds of solutions and the privacy riskâitâs maybe not the best idea.
Are there any other methods to protect children from inappropriate online content?
The nontechnical approach is to educate parents about the dangers of the Internet. When they provide a smartphone to their children, they should understand that [those kids] will be able to talk to strangers [and see and share adult content]. I donât want to blame parents; I want to warn parents and have them speak to their children.
If you want to use technology, some forms of parental controls offer a good solution. Itâs not perfect, but it gives an extra layer of protection without the [large-scale] privacy threat.
Considering your stance on Franceâs law and similar policies, how does it feel to have developed a privacy protocol to enable age verification?
I really went into it thinking, âHow can I do something that is less bad than what exists?â It was damage control, knowing [that France will adopt age verification].... Iâm pretty scared of what is going to happen. But at least now we can point to something and say, âLook, we can have some privacy.â

What Philosopher Ibn Sina Can Teach Us about AI
A philosopher who lived centuries before artificial intelligence might be able to help us understand the field's personhood questions
By Abigail Tulenko
Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (980-1037 C.E.)

In 2022, Google engineer Blake Lemoine developed a rapport with an excellent conversationalist. She was witty, insightful, and curious; their dialogues flowed naturally, on topics ranging from philosophy to TV to dreams for the future. There was just one problem: she was an AI chatbot.
In a series of conversations with Googleâs LaMDA language model, Lemoine became gradually convinced the chatbot was a personlike you or me. âI know a person when I talk to it,â he told the Washington Post in 2022.
Whether you believe Lemoineâs claims or not, the question emerges: Do we, in fact, know a person when we talk to one?

Personhood generally refers to a moral status; in most ethical frameworks, particular considerationsârights, duties, praise, blame, dignity, agencyâemerge at the level of the person. So the question of whether electronic systems do or could merit the status of personhood has wide-ranging implications for how we engage with these technologies.
To assess the possibility of e-personhood, we need some standard of personhood generally. In recent years many philosophers have argued that what makes us persons is our capacity for conscious experience. But how do we define consciousness? What external evidence can we use to determine whether a being is conscious?
The lack of consensus on these questions is one of the reasons that the debate around AI personhood has long been at a bit of a stalemate. The question emerges: What other criteria do we have for assessing the possibility of e-personhood? As a doctoral candidate studying the philosophy of science, I believe a path toward answering this futuristic question may lie in our distant pastâin the work of the early Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (980â1037 C.E.).
Ibn Sina lived centuries before the invention of the printing press, much less artificial intelligence. And yet he was concerned with many of the same questions AI ethicists think about todayâquestions like: What makes a person a person, as opposed to an animal?
Just as contemporary AI researchers are interested in comparing the processes that underpin human and AI responses to similar tasks, Ibn Sina was interested in comparing the internal processes humans and animals might undergo to arrive at similar behavior outputs. For him, one key distinguishing capacity of the human person is the capacity to grasp âthe universal.â Whereas animals can only think about particulars (the specific things right in front of them), humans can reason from generalized rules.
In Al-Nafs, Ibn Sina discusses a popular ancient example of a sheep perceiving a wolf. Whereas a human being would invoke a broad principleââWolves are generally dangerous, and this particular animal in front of me is a wolf; therefore, I should run awayââhe claims that animals think differently. They donât reason from a rule; they just see the wolf and know to run. They are limited to âparticularsââthat wolfârather than reasoning about universal qualities of wolves.
The distinction Ibn Sina draws between human and animal psychology bears strong resemblance to a distinction that contemporary computer scientists are investigating with regard to AI. Current research suggests that artificial neural networks lack the ability for systematic compositional generalizability. Linguists and cognitive scientists use this term to describe the types of inferences we make from generalized rules. Itâs widely assumed to be one of the primary ways humans reason in everyday life. Whereas humans abstract meanings from sequences of words that they can then combine into more complex ideas, AI fishes within statistical datasets for specific data entries that match the particular task at hand.
This difference explains a great deal about the limitations of contemporary AI. To see it at play, look to the ubiquitous CAPTCHA tests used to distinguish between humans and bots. âLook at these curvy letters. Much curvier than most letters, wouldnât you say? No robot could ever read these,â comedian John Mulaney quips in a 2018 Netflix special. It seems absurd, but itâs true; sufficient alterations make it difficult for even the most sophisticated artificial systems to recognize letters. This is because these systems lack the compositional capacity to make abstract generalizations about the core features of a given letter and apply it to a particular warped example.
This difference between human and artificial cognition maps neatly to Ibn Sinaâs description of what is unique about human reasoning. In al-Å hifÄ, he describes how âthe intellect â¦ learns what things are shared in common and what things are not, and so extracts the natures of things common in species.â On his account, humans extract the essential features of things from their less-essential features to form generalized concepts. We then reason using these concepts, applying them to cases.
For example, as children we learn to extract a core feature of the letter X: its being composed of two crossed lines. We then abstractâmake a universal generalization about the core features of an Xâto conclude that all Xs are composed of two crossed lines. Finally, by applying this generalization, we can recognize specific Xs. We know that two crossed lines are a core feature of the letter X and that the random additional lines and warping in the CAPTCHA image are not.
The computer, in contrast, is unable to deduce that this image represents an X unless it has been fed an exact image of an X (or something sufficiently similar). The additional lines and warped shape are enough to make this X unrecognizable, because it does not match the computerâs large repository of specific images categorized as Xs.
Similarly, if an artificial neural network were presented with the task of the sheep, it would not reason as the human does, from a general concept of wolf-ness to features of the particular wolf such as dangerousness. Instead, it would reason as the sheep does, constrained to the realm of particulars.
A crucial difference between the sheep and the artificial neural network is that the artificial neural network has access to a much larger repository of particulars in the form of increasingly exhaustive datasets. What makes deep learning so successful at language tasks is its access to large datasets of vast numbers of particulars, rather than the genuine replication of human reasoning through compositional generalizability.
Ibn Sinaâs core criterion for personhoodâreasoning from universalsâclosely resembles systematic compositional generalizability. This criterion could provide a potentially testable standard for personhood. In fact, so far, AI has failed this test in numerous studies. Whether or not one adopts it as a solution, Ibn Sinaâs account provides a new lens on the problem of personhood that challenges the assumptions of consciousness-centered accounts.
Scientific ethics is so often concerned with the cutting edgeâthe latest research, the newest technology, a constant influx of data. But sometimes the questions of the future require careful consideration of the past. Looking to history allows us to look beyond the preoccupations and assumptions of our time and may just provide refreshing approaches toward current stalemates.
