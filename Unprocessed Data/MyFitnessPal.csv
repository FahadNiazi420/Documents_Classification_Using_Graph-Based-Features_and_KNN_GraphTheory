Over the past few years, kimchi has become one of the trendier health foods. The traditional Korean dish made of fermented cabbage and/or radishes started popping up everywhere: on tacos, folded into fried rice, even in Bloody Marys.
People touted not only the flavor but also the health benefits. And now, there’s potentially another valid reason to eat more of it.
A new study in South Korea reported that kimchi can reduce the risk of obesity.
But before you go raiding the Asian aisle at the nearest grocery store, we talked to registered dietitian Katherine Basbaum, MS, RD, to find out whether or not the study is really accurate—and whether or not kimchi can prevent obesity.
In the study, which was published in the medical journal BMJ Open, researchers evaluated over 115,000 Korean adults between the ages of 40 to 69. They found that of those surveyed, men who consumed one to three servings of cabbage kimchi per day had a lower risk of obesity compared to men who ate less than one serving per day.
Additionally, women in the same age group who ate one to three servings of radish kimchi per day experienced a lower risk of abdominal obesity than those who didn’t.
So what’s so special about kimchi? Katherine says it’s all about the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which is a probiotic derived from the unique fermentation process.
Like many probiotics, LAB can boost your immune system, reduce inflammation, and improve your digestion. It can also potentially help prevent certain conditions, from colds and congestion to cancer and heart disease.
Katherine describes kimchi as a “flavorful, low calorie, high-fiber side dish.” However, she cautions that kimchi can be high in sodium, so be mindful of that if you’re watching your salt intake.
There’s no denying that kimchi can be part of a healthy diet. But as for whether or not it prevents obesity, that’s up for debate. Katherine pointed out some big flaws with this particular study.
So if kimchi isn’t the answer, what is?
“Though there are unfortunately no specific foods that have been proven to play a significant role in lowering obesity risk, there are most definitely dietary strategies that can help,” Katherine says. (Like tracking your food… MyFitnessPal can help with that!)

She recommends limiting “energy dense” foods, which are foods high in fat, sugar, and calories (think: anything processed). Instead, opt for “low energy dense” foods—like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—that are high in water and/or fiber and will keep you fuller with fewer calories.
And as always, moderation is key. In the study conclusion, researchers reported that “excessive consumption suggests the potential for an increase in obesity prevalence.” Too much of a good thing isn’t always a good thing—even if you’re eating something good for you, like kimchi.

Glycine—a single compound found in foods—is taking TikTok by storm.
The compound has been on the rise for a while, but recently went viral on social media thanks to an infomercial targeted towards “glycine girlies,” a niche group of young women obsessed with the up-and-coming supplement. But it’s sparked a conversation, with plenty of people wondering what exactly it is—and whether or not it’s worth taking.
To help answer those questions, we spoke with one of our registered dietitians Katherine Basbaum to dig into the science.
Glycine is one of the amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein in your body. “It is considered a non-essential amino acid since the body can produce glycine, as opposed to essential amino acids, which can only be obtained from dietary sources,” Basbaum explains.
That said, the amount of glycine your body produces often isn’t enough to meet your daily needs. While you can buy glycine supplements, the amino acid is also naturally found in protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, fish and legumes.
“Glycine’s main function is to help promote the growth and health of cells in the body,” Basbaum explains. However, research has shown there may be additional benefits to consuming the amino acid, which include:
How much glycine do you need for these benefits? Well, there’s no official Dietary Reference Intake for it (or any of the non-essential amino acids, for that matter). However, some studies suggest an intake of 1.5 to 3 grams per day. Basbaum says the average adult currently consumes about 2 grams per day.

If you want to up your glycine intake, Basbaum recommends prioritizing protein in your diet. “A good way to ensure adequate amino acid intake is through dietary protein such as meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, dairy, soy products, beans and legumes,” she says. You can track your protein intake through the MyFitnessPal app to get a good idea of your current consumption level.
And as for those trendy glycine supplements you might see all over TikTok, Basbaum advises against them for now. Instead, stick to real food. “Not only can you typically get all the nutrients your body needs through a balanced diet, but it is often a safer bet as dietary supplements are not regulated as rigorously by the FDA,” she cautions.

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:23,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/quality-of-calories-more-important-than-quantity/,710,"When you’re trying to lose weight, it’s almost impossible to bite into a rice cake without being offered diet advice: Cut carbs, limit fat, drink shakes, you name it. Is one approach better than another? Christopher Gardner, PhD, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, wanted to find out. You might be surprised to hear that the quality of your calories matters.
Research published in JAMA compared the effectiveness of low-carb and low-fat diets for weight loss. Researchers followed 609 overweight adults for 12 months and discovered that, on average, dieters in both groups lost similar amounts of weight: Those following a low-fat diet lost 11.7 pounds while those following a low-carb diet lost 13.2 pounds.
“There isn’t one diet for everyone.”
Within the groups, there were significant differences in how participants fared on each diet: Some dieters lost as much as 60 pounds while others gained weight, leading Gardner to explain, “There isn’t one diet for everyone.”
Although prescribing a specific diet might not be effective for weight loss, the research revealed some important information.
Participants were not asked to consume a specific number of calories, but all were asked to lower their fat or carb intake (depending on their group), choose more whole foods, including vegetables, and minimize added sugars and refined grains. Those who followed that advice, focusing on the quality of the calories they consumed over the quantity, lost significant amounts of weight — regardless of whether their diets were low-carb or low-fat.
“Steel-cut oats and kale are both low-fat; so are sodas and white bread, but the oats and kale are likely more filling, more satiating. Avocados and nuts are both low-carb; so are lard and butter, but meals made with avocados and nuts may be more filling, more satiating,” Gardner explains.
Focusing on healthier, more satiating foods helped dieters feel full while eating less.
An earlier JAMA study reported similar results. In 2012, 21 overweight adults were assigned to follow one of three diets: low-fat, low-carb or low-glycemic index for four weeks. Participants were instructed to replace grains and starches with vegetables, legumes, fruits and healthy fats. All dieters lost weight, but those who chose fewer carbs and ate more high-quality calories sped up their metabolisms, too, burning an additional 325 calories per day — about the same number of calories burned during an hour of moderate-intensity physical activity.
“The quality of the foods we eat can have fundamental effects on hormones, metabolism and even the expression of genes throughout the body.”
“The type of calories we consume affects the number of calories being burned. In other words, from a metabolic perspective, all calories are not alike to the body,” explains Dr. David S. Ludwig, co-director of the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children’s Hospital. “The quality of the foods we eat can have fundamental effects on hormones, metabolism and even the expression of genes throughout the body.”
READ MORE > THE NOT-SO-SECRET KEY TO WEIGHT-LOSS MAINTENANCE
Of course, the number of calories you consume still matters but Gardner believes it’s more important for people to choose foods that make them feel full and satisfied rather than obsessing over hitting a certain number of calories.
So, yes, [losing weight] involves eating fewer calories, but it isn’t as simple as eat less (and not as depressing either),” he says. “We would consider these quality components to be foundational to any kind of diet or eating pattern … whether they are trying out low-fat, low-carb, paleo, vegan, Mediterranean [or another diet]. It’s about finding the combinations of low-fat or low-carb meals and menus that you enjoyed and could enjoy for life that support weight goals.”

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:24,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/the-health-benefits-of-chocolate/,1243,"It’s chocolate season! With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, the deep, dark, delicious sweet treat is splashing its way across the shelves and corners of nearly every food market and gift shop. The benefits of chocolate are touted across packaging and headlined in countless articles (including this one) — but is chocolate really a superfood measuring up alongside blueberries, green tea and chia seeds?
Here’s what we know: Numerous studies have found dark chocolate to be highly nutritious and rich in antioxidants with the potential to improve blood flow, lower blood pressure, raise good HDL cholesterol, lower the risk of heart disease, enhance skin quality, reduce inflammation, and even improve blood flow to the brain. In fact, chocolate was historically eaten for its purported healing properties.
Americans spend billions (more than $20 billion, to be exact) of dollars on chocolate annually. So, does that equate to billions of touted health benefits?
Not exactly.
You have to eat a lot of commercially available chocolate to reap the benefits. And you know what comes with a lot of commercial chocolate? A lot of calories.
Chocolate (like most things) is healthiest in its most whole, pure form. However, most chocolate does not come packaged this way.
All chocolate (dark, milk, nibs, bars, chips, cocoa powder, cacao, and yes, even white) begins its journey as a fruit on the cacao tree. The seeds that grow inside these fruits are called cacao (also cocoa) beans. Once harvested, these seeds are fermented, dried, and then roasted to develop flavor. The inner nibs are the true star — nutty and earthy with a crunchy texture. In most of the chocolate bars and products available to consumers, the nibs are ground to create a chocolate liquor (which has nothing to do with a cocktail) which then gets mixed with sugar, milk powders, and other ingredients like lecithin, spices and vanilla to create different flavors and textures.
So, is there a way to work chocolate into a balanced, healthy diet? Yes, but it’s not exactly as simple as nibbling on a chocolate bar. The more the chocolate gets mashed, blended and processed, the less potent its power.
1. ANTIOXIDANT POWER
Flavonoids are a type of polyphenol found naturally in plants that help protect them from environmental toxins and repair damage. They’re extra potent antioxidants and found highly concentrated in cocoa beans (a fruit!). In high doses, these powerful compounds carry anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties, which may prevent cellular damage. More than 10% of the weight of cocoa powder is flavonoids — that’s rich!
2. HEART HELPERS
Flavonols are the main flavonoid found in cocoa beans. They’re also responsible for the bitterness we often taste in raw chocolate. Flavonols are particularly beneficial for the heart, improving blood flow, increasing circulation, reducing the risk of clotting, and potentially lowering blood pressure.
3. GOOD GUT BUILDERS
Two of the most potent flavonols in chocolate are epicatechin and catechin, which increase blood antioxidant activity, decrease oxidative stress, and may even promote better gut health. The presence of both epicatechin and catechin may improve the quality of the bacteria in our gut microbiota, increasing our “good bugs” and reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria. The darker the chocolate the better, as these effects were reduced when combined with milk.
4. IMMUNITY BOOSTERS
The antioxidants in cocoa beans help reduce oxidative stress by inhibiting and lowering the amount of free radicals in the blood stream. Free radicals have the ability to send our immune systems into overdrive!
5. BRAIN BOOSTERS
Theobromine and caffeine are the mood-and-energy-boosting components found in chocolate. Both of these substances block adenosine receptors, helping you feel more alert. When adenosine binds to its receptors, it slows neural activity and you begin to feel sleepy. Some studies even say chocolate promotes the production of serotonin (the good mood stabilizer) and also contains phenylalanine (the love molecule). But, the reality is, most of these compounds are found in very small quantities in the chocolate we eat. It’s more likely the experience we undergo while eating chocolate — that moment of instantly satisfying a food craving — is responsible for the “euphoria” we often feel after nibbling a few bites.
So, can we have our chocolate cake and eat it, too? Yes, but the darker and less sweet the chocolate, the better. Here are the benefits of consuming chocolate in its varied forms.

Cacao nibs, in pure form, are actually one of the healthiest forms of chocolate. Not only are they rich in flavonoids and antioxidants, but cacao nibs are also high in protein and fiber — with 5 grams of fiber and 2.5 grams of protein in just 2 tablespoons of nibs. But they aren’t sweet. Cacao nibs contain all of the fiber, fat, and nutrients a cacao bean does. In its raw, rare form, chocolate contains no sugar. All sugar is added in processing. The nibs are earthy and slightly bitter, with a crunch much like coffee beans.

Cocoa powder (and cacao; more on the difference, below) is made by removing cocoa butter from the liquor that comes from crushed nibs. It’s basically a concentrated source of all those flavonoids and polyphenols! A higher percentage of cocoa powder in chocolate means greater antioxidant potential and power. Unlike most other forms of chocolate, cocoa powder is low in calories (about 12 per tablespoon). It’s also rich in minerals like magnesium, copper and iron.
Cacao powder is very similar, but closer to its raw state than cocoa powder, as cocoa goes through an additional layer of high-heat roasting and processing. This “Dutch processing” removes some of the bitterness, but also some antioxidants. While both are still incredibly healthy, cacao powder is often considered one of the highest sources of antioxidants you can find!

Here’s where chocolate starts to get complicated. Every bar is different. Most have a lot of sugar, milk solids, fats and even additives mixed in with the raw, healthy chocolates mentioned above mitigating and diluting most of the benefits. Bars that have more than 70% cacao are going to be the most concentrated sources of flavonoids and polyphenols. A high-quality bar that’s concentrated can often satisfy a sweet craving in a bite or two, so find a dark bar you love and nibble sensibly.

If you are aiming to increase your antioxidant intake, this category of sweets is not likely the best place to find them! While MyFitnessPal has quite the library of better-for-you baked goods that contain chocolate, you are better off steering clear of foods that contain a lot of added sugars, calories, and refined flours.
It’s the cocoa bean, in whole form, not the chocolate bar, that carries health benefits. The more processed the chocolate, the fewer the benefits. If you really want to increase your antioxidant intake, work powders and nibs into healthy dishes to boost both flavor and benefits.

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:24,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/ask-dietitian-whats-deal-starvation-mode/,1203,"Julian Selemin is a medical and ethnobotanicals writer with several years of experience in the industry. He has a BA in Languages and is currently majoring in Contemporary Music.
Stephanie Tarnacki, RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She received her Bachelors in Dietetics from University of Northern Colorado and completed her Dietetic Internship at Montana State University. Her experience extends from adult and neonatal intensive care, diabetes, kidney, weight management to school nutrition and menu compliance.
Our bodies are very smart when it comes to surviving under harsh conditions. A fantastic — and somewhat infamous example — is adaptive thermogenesis, more commonly known as “starvation mode.”
But what is “starvation mode” and what role does it play in a weight loss journey? Here’s what you need to know.
The concept of starvation mode is simple: If you don’t eat enough, your body will believe you’re starving. In turn, your body may maintain some of your weight and fat as an attempt to preserve energy, making it harder for you to lose weight.
“Starvation mode” only happens when a substantial caloric deficit is maintained for an extended period. While the exact timeline will vary depending on several factors, one study shows that it can happen after about a week of an extreme daily caloric restriction.
There’s just no getting around it. Your body needs calories to work correctly.
If you don’t eat enough, your body will slip into “adaptive thermogenesis,” the scientific term for “starvation mode.” This will slow your whole metabolism down, causing several side effects that will become more and more noticeable the longer you maintain the calorie deficit.
Here’s a quick rundown of the most common “starvation mode” symptoms:
The exact symptoms may vary from person to person but are usually accompanied by a general decrease in your weight loss rate. If you start experiencing any of these side effects, contact a doctor or nutritionist as soon as possible.
When in “starvation mode”, your metabolic rate may decrease significantly, especially if you lose too much weight too quickly. Metabolic rate refers to the number of calories you burn daily, making it crucial to the caloric intake and outtake formula.
The exact numbers will vary depending on how fast you lose body weight, but a good rule of thumb is that adaptive thermogenesis will kick in after about one week of severe caloric restriction, which is restricting total daily energy intake to be below basal metabolic rate (BMR).
BMR is the amount of energy in calories your body needs just to do the basics—breathing, circulating blood, regulating body temperature, and repairing cells—when at rest. Think of it as the calories you’d burn if you stayed in bed all day. It’s affected by things like your age, sex, weight, height, body composition, and even genes.
And, according to registered dietitian and scientific advisory Scott Keatley, 1,200 calories is the absolute bare minimum a human body needs daily. (Aka, the lowest BMR you can have). “Even someone under 5 feet and 100 pounds needs more if they do anything beyond blink,” he says.
No, intermittent fasting is different from “starvation mode.”
First, fasting is only done for a predetermined amount of time, preventing you from going into adaptive thermogenesis.
To put it simply, fasting is a controlled, short-term caloric deficit, while starvation mode is an automatic mechanism that kicks in during long-term, low-calorie diets.
Intermittent fasting can be beneficial to some, providing several health benefits, such as reducing oxidative stress and boosting brain function. Starvation mode, on the other hand, is a sign of damage to your body due to an extended caloric deficit. Remember, consult with your physician before starting any new diet regime, including intermittent fasting, to ensure it is right for you.
There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that intermittent fasting has helped people lose weight alongside a healthy, whole food diet.
The first — and maybe most frustrating — side effect of low-calorie diets is that “starvation mode” can cause your weight loss rate to stall. This can quickly become a catch-22: You eat less because you’re not losing weight, and you don’t lose weight because you’re not eating enough.
Over time, starvation can also cause your muscle mass to decrease due to the overall reduction of calories, weight, and energy. Similarly, your overall body temperature will drop.
A body in “starvation mode” for extended periods is also more vulnerable to illnesses and wounds. The risk of anxiety, irritability, and depression also rises, and you may even develop feelings of guilt and shame surrounding food.
Here are some other long-term “starvation mode” side effects:
If you think you may be in starvation mode, we suggest you notify your doctor right away.
Let’s face it — losing weight can be challenging. A desperation to lose weight quickly can lead to decisions that may work in the short term but are harmful in the long run.
You should avoid an aggressive approach to weight loss at all costs, as it will often lead you to patterns like yo-yo dieting. Instead, we think the best approach to weight loss is adopting healthy nutritional and lifestyle decisions you can maintain long-term.
This includes exercise, one of the main pillars of weight loss. Moderate exercise can greatly contribute to your losing weight while also keeping your body and mind healthy and active. But even light exercise can help!
You may also want to consider your current eating habits. Do you often find yourself snacking away through the night? Do you eat more when you’re anxious and stressed? Taking note of these habits can help you find common pitfalls in your diet and avoid unnecessary weight gain.
We recommend you keep a food diary to identify any possible patterns. If you’re not too keen on using pen and paper, MyFitnessPal features an extensive food diary with many features to help you start correcting your eating habits ASAP!
If you lose too much weight too quickly, your metabolic rate will decrease, making your weight loss journey much more difficult.
That’s why it’s crucial to follow a healthy weight loss plan that maintains (or even increases) your metabolic rate through exercise and a well-balanced diet. With several useful tools — such as a calorie tracker and food diary — the MyFitnessPal app is the perfect companion for all your weight loss efforts!

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:25,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/whats-healthier-white-or-dark-meat-chicken/,688,"Whether you’re trying to lose weight or gain muscle, both white and dark meat chicken can be a healthy staple in many diets — and for good reason. “Chicken is a wonderful source of protein,” says Mascha Davis, MPH, RD, a Los Angeles-based dietitian. “Because it comes from animal muscle, it has all of the essential amino acids humans need to stay healthy.” Plus, that protein has high bioavailability — meaning your body easily absorbs it and uses it for various functions — because the quality and amino acid distribution closely mimics ours, she explains.
Moreover, chicken is rich in key minerals and vitamins such as iron, zinc, B vitamins and selenium. So, including white or dark meat chicken in your diet may help boost your health. But whether you opt for white or dark meat might depend on your goals.
Here, nutritionists weigh in on the pros and cons to consider the next time you’re deciding whether to eat white meat or dark meat chicken.

Compared to dark meat chicken, white meat is lower in fat and slightly higher in niacin, a B vitamin that helps convert food to energy. “Given that a chicken breast has a fairly low calorie density for the amount of protein provided, consuming chicken may promote weight loss or weight maintenance,” says Georgia Rounder, RD.
On the other hand, three ounces of roasted, skinless dark-meat chicken meat contains more calories, fat and less protein. However, because it’s higher in myoglobin than white meat, dark meat chicken has more iron and zinc. And because it’s higher in fat, it has about twice as many healthy omega-3 fatty acids as white meat, Davis says.
“White meat is actually less nutrient-rich than dark meat,” notes Rounder. “Myoglobin is the special protein that determines the color of the chicken meat. The more myoglobin, the darker the meat and the more nutrient-rich the piece of meat is,” she explains.
White meat chicken is a blank slate when it comes to flavoring and cooking. You can marinate it, coat it in spice rub, slather it in a healthy sauce or top it with salsa or compote. You can also prepare it in many healthy ways, such as roasting, baking, grilling or stir-frying. “White meat chicken is a very versatile protein and a great option for people looking to lower the amount of saturated fat in their diet for heart health reasons,” Davis says.
While dark meat is just as versatile when it comes to cooking and seasoning as white meat, the higher fat content gives dark meat a richer, juicier flavor and texture, Rounder points out. It’s also usually cheaper than white meat.
“Both versions of chicken are good to incorporate into your diet due to the volume of nutrients they provide,” Rounder says. “The decision ultimately depends on your personal health goals.” For example, if you are watching fat, you may want to primarily eat white meat with some dark meat here and there.
However, your budget also matters. “Very often, the most economical and delicious option is to buy a whole chicken with the intent of eating every part,” Davis says. “Depending on the types of fat in your overall diet that day or that week and what tastes good to you, you may want to choose one part of the chicken over the other.”
Regardless, it’s best to avoid the skin, which is high in unhealthy fat and calories (about 1.5 grams of saturated fat and 40 calories per three ounces of meat).

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:26,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/your-comprehensive-list-of-nut-butters-and-their-health-benefits/,815,"If you’re eager to eat more plant-based protein, consider adding nut butter to your menu. These healthy spreads are brimming with vitamins and minerals, and they’re available in enough flavors to appeal to nearly every palate.
“The variety of nut butters allow us to have more options, resulting in a greater variety of nutrients in our diet,” says Katie Hake, RD. If you don’t love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, there are plenty of other ways to eat nut butter. You can bake with it, add it to smoothies, soups and more.
Some research has shown nut butter consumption is associated with a lower risk of Type 2 diabetes in women. Other research found people who regularly consume nuts have a lower risk of heart disease. While the nutritional profile of each nut butter varies depending on its main ingredient, all forms can be beneficial to your health (for those who don’t have allergies).
“Nut butters provide healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and plant-based compounds important for good health,” says Marie Spano, MS, RD, sports nutritionist for the Atlanta Braves, Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Falcons. And a little goes a long way since nut butters average about 200 calories per 2 tablespoon serving.
When you’re at the grocery store and trying to look for the healthiest option, keep in mind you should look for ones that “have the shortest list of ingredients, because our bodies can process them better,” says Sandra Arévalo, RD, a New York-based spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Try to find a brand that doesn’t have added sugar, sodium or other additives.
Here, RDs weigh in on seven great nut butters to include in your diet:

This tried-and-true product isn’t technically a nut butter, since peanuts are considered legumes. Nonetheless, it’s the most commonly consumed nut butter in the U.S., with the longest history on supermarket shelves. It holds a distinction among the nut butters: “Peanut butter tends to be the highest in protein, compared to its competitors,” says Hake. It’s also rich in vitamin E, vitamin B6 and a number of minerals, including magnesium and potassium. “It can help combat cholesterol and improve conditions such as anemia [and] heart disease,” says Arévalo. It’s also super versatile, making it easy to pair with something like a banana for a well-balanced snack.

“Almond butter has become more popular over the years, due to its more unique texture and taste,” says Hake. “Just two tablespoons can provide important minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and potassium.” It’s also rich in vitamin E, “which is great for the maintenance of healthy skin, and contains copper and phosphorus which help improve bone strength,” adds Arévalo.

Although it’s technically a seed, this spread is “a great option for those with tree nut or peanut allergies,” says Spano. “It’s an excellent source of pantothenic acid, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese. It is also a good source of protein, folate and zinc.”
What’s more, sunflower seed butter may be particularly beneficial for women. “Sunflower seeds have high amounts of B6 and magnesium that have been linked to reduction of cardiovascular disease, menstruation difficulties and premenstrual syndrome,” explains Arévalo.

When you think hazelnut, you may be tempted to reach for a jar of Nutella. Instead, look for natural varieties without the chocolate, salt and excess sugar. “Hazelnut butter is an excellent source of vitamin E, copper and manganese and also contains thiamin and magnesium,” says Spano.
This nut butter is also rich in folic acid and potassium, which “aids the production of hormones and helps reduce the risk of certain cancers,” Arévalo says. “It can even help reduce high blood pressure.”

If you’re looking for a lower-calorie option, try pistachio butter. “It’s a good source of protein and lower in fat than most other butters,” says Spano. “It also contains thiamin, vitamin B6, phosphorous, copper and manganese.”

“Walnut butter contains the highest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, which are beneficial to both brain and heart health,” says Hake. It can have a creamier, thicker texture compared to other nut butters, but pairs nicely with spices like cinnamon.

“Cashews are rich in many B vitamins like B12, B1 and B5, which help correct metabolic disorders,” says Arévalo. “Pay attention to how much you consume though, because it is the highest in calories.”

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:28,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/all-about-alternatives-milk/,746,"The milk aisle definitely isn’t what it used to be, even 10 years ago. With plant-based diets increasing in popularity, more individuals are switching things up from regular cow’s milk to trying milk derived from plants like almonds, coconut, peas, cashews, and oats (to name a few). There seems to be a new kind of plant milk popping up every couple of months, vying for the title “best new alt milk.” But how do these “alt” milks stack up nutrition-wise? Let’s take a look.

Almond milk may be one of the “OG” alt milks, but it has had some strong staying power against some of the newer plant milks. I think this is partly because of its simple, mild flavor that works in anything from a latte to a bowl of cereal, and partly because of its nutrition profile. Depending on the brand and flavor, some almond milk differs slightly in nutrient content. In general, almond milk is relatively low in most nutrients, including protein, fat, carbohydrates and calories. It is not a good source of most vitamins and minerals, but many almond milk brands are fortified with vitamin D, B12 and calcium.

Pea milk is one of the newer alt milks, and it differentiates itself from some of the others because it’s a good source of plant-based protein. At about 8 grams per cup, pea milk is comparable to cow’s milk and soy milk in the protein department, and may be a good option if that macro is important to you. Protein helps promote satiety and satisfaction after meals, and this makes pea milk a good option for things like smoothies and protein shakes. It has a mild flavor so is fairly versatile and can even be used in baking. Like almond milk, fortified versions of pea milk contain vitamin D, calcium, B12 and potassium.

Maybe the newest alt milk, oat milk is, you guessed it, made from oats. Since oats themselves are packed with nutrition, especially heart-healthy soluble fiber, one would hope at least some of that transfers over to oat milk. And it does, to a point. One cup of oat milk contains about 1 gram of soluble fiber, and more protein compared to almond milk (about 3 grams per cup). Since it’s made from a carbohydrate (oats), oat milk contains more carbs compared to some other alt milks, with about 16 grams per cup. The nutrient density here helps make oat milk a hearty, filling choice. It’s great on the side of fruit or a piece of toast for a snack, or in your favorite espresso beverage.

Coconut milk (not the stuff in the can, but the kind you buy in the alt milk aisle), can add delicious flavor to coffee beverages, yogurts or on its own with a cookie. It does differ the most nutritionally from the other examples listed above, however. Coconut milk is the only alt milk here with fat primarily made up of saturated fat, which is usually found in animal products but is also the primary fat in coconuts. Saturated fat can contribute to elevated LDL cholesterol levels, and I do recommend limiting it or replacing it with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats when possible. Coconut milk also contains no protein, so that’s something to keep in mind if you want your alt milk to be a protein source. Coconut milk is fairly low in vitamins and minerals, but many brands are fortified with vitamin D, calcium, vitamin A and B12.
Alt milk is a great place to explore if you’re trying to include more plant-based foods in your diet. While they differ in some ways nutritionally, no one is “better” than the other. Choose your alt milk for flavor, consistency and honestly, whichever one you like the best. Just make sure to read the nutrition label to be in the know about whether or not your milk is fortified with important vitamins like D, calcium and B12.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the conflicting nutritional advice out there, you’re not alone. In this Nutribollocks series, our registered dietitians and scientific advisory board members take a hard look at scientific studies and claims, separating fact from fiction so you don’t have to.
Over the last few years, apple cider vinegar has blossomed into a trendy weight loss supplement, with plenty of celebrities and health and wellness influencers touting its fat-burning benefits. From daily ACV shots to vinegar-filled gummies, the pantry staple became a much-talked-about topic.
And now, there may be science behind the ACV obsession. A recent study published in the BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health journal claims that daily consumption of apple cider vinegar could be linked to significant weight loss.
Because we’re dedicated to ensuring the nutrition information we share is backed by credible science, we did a little investigating. We asked Dr. Nicola Guess, nutrition scientist and member of the MyFitnessPal Scientific Advisory Board, to dig into the research and tell us: is this fact? Or is it nutribollocks?
The verdict: Likely Nutribollocks.
Think something as simple as drinking apple cider vinegar to achieve your weight loss goals sounds too good to be true? Well, you might be right. Dr. Guess describes this specific study as unreliable, pointing out a few major flaws.
“The degree of weight loss is extremely unusual,” she says, comparing it to other trials. “Even in trials where they do see an impact of ACV on weight, it’s typically a difference of 1.0-1.5k g compared to the close to 7 kg weight loss they see here.” This means people were losing about a pound per week with the ACV and no reported caloric deficit, which Dr. Guess notes isn’t in line with any research she’s seen.
Here’s another thing to think about. Sometimes when a research study shows really surprising results like this one, we need to consider if the design of the study and the data collected are reliable enough to make strong conclusions. After looking at the study, Dr. Guess didn’t think it was good enough to prove that ACV could actually significantly help with weight loss as suggested.
That’s not to say that apple cider vinegar has zero effect on weight loss—just that more research needs to be done for any conclusive evidence. “There are other studies that show a minor benefit to consuming ACV, but there aren’t many studies in humans demonstrating this,” Dr. Guess explains. “Because consuming ACV in small doses (1-2 tbsp/day) is low-risk, we don’t recommend against it, but don’t depend on it for weight loss.”
Apple cider vinegar may not be the cure-all that the study claims it to be. Fortunately, there are other drinks that might help speed up your weight loss, according to MFP lead scientist Stephanie Nelson. The key is to stop drinking your calories. Caloric beverages are typically high in sugar but they don’t fill you up the way food would..
“I’d recommend beverages that are easy swaps for sugary drinks. This includes flavored sparkling waters or diet soda for regular soda and coffee with sugar-free flavored creamer instead of flavored lattes,” MFP lead scientist Stephanie Nelson says.
However, at the end of the day, weight loss is less about what you drink or what trendy supplements you take and more about what you eat. “It’s still most effective to lose weight through tracking and eating a high-quality diet,” Dr. Guess explains.
You can do both of those things through the MyFitnessPal app—which is a great place to start if your goal is sustainable weight loss. No shots of vinegar necessary.

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:31,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/ultra-processed-foods-that-are-dietitian-approved/,1491,"Catrina Cowart is a writer and editor with over 14 years of professional experience. As a long-time freelance and agency writer, she focuses on writing in niches including health and wellness, medical, legal, travel, the arts, and science and technology.
Emily Sullivan, RD is a food data curator at MyFitnessPal. She earned her bachelor's degree and completed her dietetic internship at The Ohio State University, and obtained her culinary arts degree from Johnson and Wales University. Her experience extends from nutrition research, oncology nutrition, culinary nutrition education and recipe development.
You’ve probably come across articles and social media posts saying that ultra-processed foods are bad for your health. And sure, there may be some truth to this. But the nutritional value of all ultra-processed foods found isn’t always black or white. That is, not all ultra-processed foods are created equal.
So, you might think you need to toss out all your deli meats or salad dressings to skip overly processed foods, but that’s not necessarily the case. In fact, some ultra-processed foods can still play a positive role in your diet.
We spoke to several dietitians to get their advice on ultra-processed foods and when to add or cut them out of your diet. Here’s what you should know.
Ultra-processed foods (UPF) are typically packaged foods that have been created with manufactured ingredients—aka, things you wouldn’t normally find in a kitchen.
By definition, they are “formulations of ingredients and food substances, some of which are not used in culinary preparations, to imitate the qualities of unprocessed or minimally processed items. They can also include ingredients that disguise any undesirable final product.”
Translated to English, they’re typically packaged foods that have been created with manufactured ingredients—aka, things you wouldn’t normally find in a kitchen.
Does that mean you have to cut these foods out of your meal meal planning? You may be surprised by the answer.
A lot of people think that super-processed foods are basically junk and should be avoided whenever possible. But according to Emily Sullivan, a dietitian who works with MyFitnessPal, that’s not always true.
“One of the biggest misconceptions about ultra-processed foods is that they all provide little to no nutritional value,” she says. “In reality, this food classification doesn’t reference the actual nutritional contents of the food, only the degree to which it was processed.”
Simply put: there are exceptions. In fact, in a study back in 2023, the USDA found that a predesigned menu where almost all the calories came from super-processed foods still provided most of the nutrients you need to stay healthy, except for a few like Choline, vitamin D, and vitamin E.
Ultra-processed foods can be all over the map when it comes to how nutritious they are for you. That’s probably why the research shows that eating a diet rich in ultra-processed foods often leads to negative health outcomes.
But, by keeping an eye on sugar, fat, salt, and calories, you can still fit them into your diet in moderation. Eating ultra-processed foods with higher nutritional values will be the key to success and improved diet quality.
Here’s a list of ultra-processed foods that MyFitnessPal’s dietitians give a thumbs up to.
Soy milk and unsweetened almond milk are considered ultra-processed foods, but they’re both great choices for your diet. Fortified soy milk is a good source of Vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium, and protein (with 7g to 9g per serving). Soy milk also lacks saturated fat, which is found in cow’s milk.
Unsweetened almond milk is a good alternative for those who don’t want to drink soy or cow’s milk. It is also a UPF but doesn’t have high amounts of added sugar or sodium.
Whole grain crackers may fall into the processed or ultra-processed food categories. Yet they are an excellent source of whole grains and a convenient way to get some top nutrients, including fiber, vitamin E, and B vitamins. For an added benefit, you can combine these crackers with less processed foods and bulk up on other necessary nutrients.
Protein powders often fall into the processed, and sometimes ultra-processed, categories. But they can be a great solution for those who struggle to get enough protein in their diets!
Alternatively, protein bars are more likely to be ultra-processed foods but are still a good way to increase protein intake, especially for busy individuals.
Salad dressing helps add flavor to what might otherwise be a bland salad, but like many other condiments, dressings are often ultra-processed. When you purchase salad dressing, be sure to read the label and try to identify the best-quality dressing available. Look for salad dressings low in added sugar and saturated fat.
Rice cakes are beneficial because they have few carbohydrates, and they work well as bases for peanut butter and chocolate chips, nut butter, berries, or other add-ons. Don’t forget to check the food labels before buying these UPFs, since some rice cakes have additives or are loaded up with added sugar– something that Americans tend to over-consume.
Breakfast cereals come in a wide range of flavors, colors, and textures. Some are super sweet, and there are many you may want to find alternatives on a quest to eat a more nutritious diet.
But you should know that even whole grain, lightly sweetened breakfast cereals are ultra-processed foods. While keeping that in mind, look for cereals that contain fewer than 10g of added sugar per serving.
A good option? Kashi Go Peanut Butter Crunch cereal. It has 8g of fiber, 10g of protein, and 9g of added sugars per serving, making it a good choice for your first meal of the day.

Eating whole-grain bread is another good way to add whole grains to your diet. When commercially produced, this type of bread is ultra-processed. However, getting over half your grains from whole-grain sources is still recommended.
Whole-grain foods are full of vitamins and nutrients, and they are rich in fiber. Fiber can help reduce blood cholesterol levels and may help you reduce the risk of developing heart disease, too. Check the nutrition label to ensure the bread you’re eating is whole grain. The first ingredient should be “whole grain.”
Out of this entire list of ultra-processed foods, Greek yogurt is one of the few with gut-friendly probiotics. It’s known that eating these probiotics can have a positive effect on diseases such as diabetes, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular conditions.
When shopping for yogurt, look for one with no more than 5g of added sugar.
There are several types of soy-based meat alternatives, including Morningstar veggie burgers and chik’n nuggets. These are both classified as ultra-processed foods but can be a good choice as a plant-based protein alternative.
Soy-based meat products don’t have as much saturated fat as real meat, making them an excellent solution for those looking for high-protein meat alternatives at lunch or dinner.
Tomato-based pasta sauces in jars often fall into the ultra-processed category, but they’re not necessarily an unhealthy option. Check the ingredients when you choose your next tomato or spaghetti sauce, as some will have less added sugar or salt.
If you want to add additional vegetables to your diet, consider choosing a tomato-based pasta sauce with carrots or onions in the mix. Put this sauce over whole-grain pasta to make an easy meal with nutritional benefits.
When you look at all the ultra-processed foods around you, it can be hard to imagine how you will avoid those that could be harmful while still retaining the healthier UPFs in your diet.
Fortunately, if you eat the items on this list in combination with unprocessed foods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, you’ll build a well-rounded diet that contains the nutrients your body needs to be at its best.
Use MyFitnessPal to keep track of the calories in the foods you’re eating. Track all added sugars and fats, and keep an eye on your sodium intake. If you’re consuming more than the recommended amount, place a focus back on the UPFs you’re eating and see if you can cut back or swap them out for more nutrient-dense UPFs.

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:32,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/are-mocktails-healthy-what-a-dietitian-wants-you-to-know/,343,"Mocktails, which are non-alcoholic alternatives to cocktails, have gained popularity as a refreshing and sociable beverage choice. The rise of the sober curiosity trend since 2018 has played a significant role in the increased interest in mocktails. This trend, coupled with initiatives like Dry January, has encouraged more people to explore and enjoy the world of alcohol-free drinks. But are mocktails healthy?
We had the opportunity to sit down with Daisy Mercer, a dietitian who works with MyFitnessPal, to gain insights into the nutritional aspects of mocktails and how they fit into a balanced diet.
Mercer appreciates mocktails as an excellent substitute for alcoholic beverages, especially in social settings. “Mocktails are a great alternative to alcohol. Many social gatherings revolve around drinking, and it can be uncomfortable for someone not drinking if they don’t have a drink in hand.”
So, in other words, yes, mocktails can definitely be healthy alternatives to cocktails or other alcoholic beverages — but there are nuances to understand.
What makes mocktails “healthy”
What to look out for when buying or making mocktails
Numerous studies corroborate the health advantages of mocktails:
There are tons you can buy at the grocery store or make at home. But here are a few we recommend starting with if you’re new to the mocktail-making scene:
Or choose from 12 additional mocktail recipes. We’re also sharing some mocktail inspo on our TikTok and Instagram.
Choosing mocktails over their alcoholic counterparts generally aligns with health and wellness goals. Just remember to make informed choices, read nutrition labels — specifically paying attention to caloric and added sugar content — and sip easy knowing you’re making a decision that aligns with your health goals. (You probably won’t miss the hangovers, either!)

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:32,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/ask-the-rd-whats-the-healthiest-cooking-oil/,1052,"Cooking oils differ in nutrients, flavor profile, and the level of heat they can withstand, which is why it can be helpful to include a variety in your diet. Like other food products, there can be misinformation floating around, especially when fat content is unfairly demonized. Fat is an essential macronutrient the body requires for cell growth, absorption of important nutrients like vitamin B and energy.
Moreover, cooking nutrient-rich foods like vegetables and lean proteins in oil helps them caramelize, browning the natural sugar and amino acids, so they have more depth and flavor and keep you satiated longer. Fat can also add creaminess to things like salad dressings, so they’re enjoyable, and you don’t feel a need to mindlessly snack after a meal.
Here’s a look at five popular cooking oils and how they compare nutritionally:

Avocado oil has gained popularity in recent years, and rightfully so. It is pressed from avocados, and, like olive oil, is high in the heart-healthy monounsaturated fat oleic acid. Avocado oil is also rich in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant. For the most health benefits, choose unrefined, cold-pressed avocado oil.
Avocado oil has a higher smoke point (around 480°F or 248°C) than olive oil and is better suited for high-heat cooking. Because of its pleasant flavor, avocado oil is also excellent as a salad dressing base or used in an aioli to accompany veggies.

Canola oil was developed in Canada (and that’s how it got its name, CANola), by crossbreeding the rapeseed plant to contain fewer toxic compounds. Canola oil is considered “refined,” meaning it goes through more chemical processing during production, which may have an effect on the fatty acid quality and reduce the nutrient content. However, it contains both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. It’s also high in linoleic acid, which is an omega-6 fatty acid.
While omega-6 fats are important, they can be inflammatory if consumed in disproportionately higher amounts than omega-3 fatty acids. The typical Western diet is much higher in omega-6 fats compared to omega-3 fats (which can be found in whole foods like fatty fish, walnuts and flaxseeds), partly because canola oil can be found in a large variety of processed foods.
Canola oil has a high smoke point (400°F or 204°C) and can be used for high-heat cooking. Because it has a mild, neutral flavor, it can be used in a variety of cooking methods such as sauteing, stir-frying, grilling and baking.

Coconut oil had its moment in the sun a few years ago, and though its popularity seems to have slowed, it can still be an occasional tool in the kitchen. It is made by pressing fresh coconut meat and extracting the oil, and the least processed version is typically labeled virgin or cold-pressed as opposed to refined. Unlike other cooking oils, coconut consists primarily of saturated fat, so it is solid at room temperature. It’s a bit different from the saturated fat found in animal products like butter, however, because some of the saturated fat in coconut oil is a medium-chain fatty acid called lauric acid. It is thought that lauric acid is absorbed more quickly by the body and used for energy, as opposed to being stored as fat. Regardless, numerous studies have found coconut oil may contribute to elevated LDL cholesterol levels and triglycerides, so it shouldn’t be considered a heart-healthy oil. Coconut oil does not contain significant amounts of other vitamins, minerals or macronutrients.
Coconut oil has a smoke point of around 375–400°F or 190–204°C. It should be used occasionally when and if it makes sense. For example, it can add a nice flavor to sautéed vegetables, curry dishes and as a substitute for butter in some baking recipes.

Olive oil is also a good source of vitamins E and K, which support heart and bone health, respectively. Olive oil is derived from olives, which are pressed to extract oil. Extra virgin oil is the least processed form of olive oil and the most nutritious because of its antioxidant content; it also has the richest flavor. Olive oil is a good source of monounsaturated fats, especially oleic acid, which is important for cardiac health, reducing inflammation and may help lower LDL and total cholesterol. Consuming a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil may also help reduce the risk of breast cancer, as found in a large randomized clinical trial.
Olive oil has a smoke point of around 350–410°F (176–210°C) and can be used for sauteing and frying at medium-high heat, roasting veggies and as a base for salad dressings thanks to its delicious flavor.

Sunflower oil is made from pressing the oil from sunflower seeds. It is an excellent source of vitamin E, and is high in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Like canola oil, sunflower oil is high in omega-6 fatty acids, and when consumed frequently and in much higher amounts than omega-3 fats, it can be inflammatory. However, many sunflower oils contain higher amounts of oleic acid (a monounsaturated fat), which may have similar heart health benefits as compared to other high oleic acid oils.
Sunflower oil has a high smoke point, 450°F (232°C), and can be used for high-heat cooking. It has a mild flavor and can be used in a variety of sautes, stir-fries and even baking recipes.
If you’re looking for the most nutrient-dense option, olive oil has the most scientific research backing its numerous health benefits. That said, it’s always important to include variety in your diet and take into account what you’re making, the heat level you need for cooking, and the desired flavor profile when choosing which oil to use. Having a couple of options in your kitchen arsenal is the best way to keep your diet exciting and enjoyable.

Regular physical activity is vital for anyone trying to lose or maintain a healthy weight.
You can do many things that burn body fat, create a calorie deficit, and help you get in shape. The real question is: Which cardiovascular exercise is best for weight loss?
Swimming, cycling, and running are all excellent workouts if you do them consistently. But if you enjoy running you’re in luck, running can be a great way to burn calories and promote weight loss. Compared to these other forms of exercise, one study shows that running burns more calories per mile, because it takes more time to run a mile rather than biking.
If you’re starting your journey to better health and are considering running for weight loss, this guide will provide seven easy tips that will have you up and running (pun intended) before you know it.
Yes, you can.
But note that it’s impossible to specifically go running to lose belly fat because that’s not how exercise works. You can do crunches all day to strengthen your abdomen, but the only way to shrink your belly is by losing overall body fat, and running is a terrific option.
Of course, going for a run isn’t the only effective way to lose weight. For example, this 20-minute high-intensity interval training can help torch calories even faster.
But if you prefer less intense exercise levels, running is a great way to go.

A decade ago, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory released a study showing the positive correlation between running and weight loss. More recently, a Czech study of over 1,000 adult runners confirmed earlier findings, concluding that a regular running workout to lose weight improves physical fitness. It does this by significantly reducing body fat under the skin as well as around your organs.
Translation: Jogging for weight loss works.
So, if you’re a beginner determined to lose weight running, keep reading to learn how to start racking up the miles and shedding pounds in no time.
When you’re focused on a long-term goal, the little details matter. Use these strategies to get the most out of your runs.
Not all runs are created equal. So before you lace up, it’s good to know about the different types, their benefits, and which are best for beginners running for weight loss.
Some new runners are so focused on losing weight that they make critical fueling mistakes — such as not eating enough carbs — that can impede their long-term goals.
That’s why one of the best ways to lose weight from running is to combine it with a diet that supports physical activity.
If you’ve never run before or aren’t used to regular exercise, it’s normal to be intimidated at first.
The good news is you don’t have to start with running. First-timers can begin by simply walking every day. For some people, a half-hour walk may even burn more fat than a thirty minute workout.
Starting slow has the added benefits of being more enjoyable and sustainable while minimizing the risk of injury. As you get more comfortable and your body adjusts to the new exercise routine, you can slowly progress from walking to running.
Once you’re running on a regular basis, there’s something else to look forward to.
You’ve probably heard of the euphoric experience during long runs caused by the brain releasing endorphins and neurochemicals. Good news: Runner’s high is a real thing.
Although you aren’t likely to hit a “runner’s high” as a beginner, it’s something to look forward to as you slowly build up the pace, frequency, and distance of your runs.
Fun fact: 5,720 workouts are tracked per minute in the MyFitnessPal app.
Every runner needs to stay hydrated, but it’s crucial for beginners demanding more from their bodies.
Hydration provides energy, improves performance, affects mood and breathing, and may even increase your metabolic rate. The risks associated with dehydration range from minor headaches and cramping to severe complications such as heart disease and heat stroke. Apps like MyFitnessPal are incredibly useful for beginners since they help you track your hydration throughout the day.
Going for a run is a great workout, but you’re unlikely to see any changes in your current weight without consistency.
One way to keep yourself on track is to create a running schedule to lose weight. Whether you start with one or two runs per week or choose a more frequent routine, staying disciplined will help your body adjust faster.
Regardless of your weight loss running plan, stick to your schedule and be consistent in order to make the most of your running for long-term improvement. With MyFitnessPal, you can factor the calories you lose during a run into your daily caloric goals, giving you an extra boost of motivation to get out there and hit the pavement.
Yes, we mentioned it, but it’s worth repeating the importance of a balanced, nutritious diet to complement physical activity.
Some people are so excited to see results when they start running that they try to accelerate their weight loss by eating less. Methods such as yo-yo dieting aren’t sustainable and can have a negative impact, including regaining all the weight lost running.
Finally, getting enough sleep each night is a health benefit that directly impacts weight loss by regulating metabolism and appetite, improving running endurance, and keeping hunger hormones in check. With sleep features, MyFitnessPal can also provide invaluable insights about your sleep patterns, helping you optimize your sleep by identifying foods inhibiting sleep.

Although running can help you reach your goals, weight loss isn’t a trip around the block.
A run/walk program is fantastic for jump-starting your journey, but keeping the weight off long-term requires consistency and a diet that accounts for caloric intake.
That’s where MyFitnessPal can help. With the right tools and resources, you can overcome past hurdles, take the mystery out of weight loss, and help achieve your fitness goals once and for all.

MyFitnessPal,4/26/2024,11:38:36,https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/what-are-healthiest-coffee-creamers/,917,"If you’re among the millions of Americans who enjoy a creamy texture and hint of flavor in your morning brew, you’re probably constantly looking for the best healthy coffee creamers.

The good news? There are plenty of healthy creamer options to choose from. Today, we’re providing our top picks for the best alternatives to replace traditional coffee creamers and preserve the sanctity of your daily coffee ritual.
For a true enthusiast, the best coffee creamer isn’t just low in fat and sugar; it also has high-quality ingredients and natural flavors that make no concessions on taste.
Although there are many healthy options available, we’ve scoured the shelves and consulted with registered dietitian Katherine Basbaum compile a list of the healthiest coffee creamers in three categories: healthiest powdered coffee creamers, dairy creamers, and plant-based creamers.
As far as powdered, non-dairy coffee creamers go, they don’t get much healthier than the Think Creamer from Four Sigmatic. With only 15 calories per serving and no added sugars, consider switching to this healthiest coffee creamer for weight loss. You won’t believe how rich and flavorful your coffee gets with less than a teaspoon!
This unique coffee creamer even has added benefits. The creamy powder is infused with organic lion’s mane, which can positively affect your mental focus, such as enhancing memory function. This organic option also uses tea extract (L-Theanine), and according to Basbaum, “L-Theanine can offer sustained energy and promote mental health.”
Nutritional content per suggested serving (1 tbsp):
Prymal Creamer, cinnamon dolce
Imagine a morning latte that’s just as delicious as your favorite big brand cinnamon dulce but with zero grams of sugar instead of 20? That’s what you get with Prymal. With a wide selection including Salted Caramel, French Vanilla, and Butter Pecan, all of Prymal’s powdered coffee creamers are completely sugar-free with no artificial flavors.
Our pick, Cinnamon Dolce, uses only natural, plant-based ingredients such as monk fruit and stevia for an authentic cinnamon and brown sugar taste. The natural coffee creamer also includes coconut oil, erythritol, and chicory root extract. Basbaum says, “Since there’s no added glucose, it’s a great option for those on keto diets or anyone who wants to reap the benefits of cutting back on sugar.”
Nutritional content per suggested serving (4 tsp):
Chobani® dairy coffee creamer, sweet cream
For anyone who wants a low-fat creamer made from real dairy products, the Chobani® line line is perfect for you.
Using only four ingredients — real milk, natural cream, cane sugar, and natural flavors — these creamers contain no artificial flavors, sweeteners, preservatives, emulsifiers, or carrageenans.

Nutritional content per suggested serving (1 tbsp):

The result? A silky smooth milk ideal for steaming and foaming. Basbaum adds, “With the benefits of switching to plant-based milk beginning to pile up, this Kosher, gluten-free option is ideal if you take your coffee without sugar.”
Nutritional content per suggested serving (240 ml):

Plant-based meat alternatives are having their moment in the sun, even for consumers who aren’t full-time vegetarians or vegans.
Did you know seven in 10 Americans eat plant-based foods and return for more? Of the households buying plant-based meals, 80% are repeat buyers.
Health is a primary reason people go plant-based, and science backs that choice. Eating more plant-based foods can help you reduce certain health risks, like heart disease and high blood pressure.
Fortunately, there are plenty of meat alternatives to explore. One popular comparison is tempeh vs. tofu vs. seitan — the plant-based trifecta.
Let’s dive in.
According to the Institute of Medicine, protein should make up 10% to 35% of your calories. This includes plant-based proteins.
Tofu, or bean curd, is a popular meat substitute consisting of soybeans and water. The soy-water mix becomes tofu when you add a coagulant, which thickens and binds the mixture.
There are three types of tofu coagulants:
Each has a different chemical effect on soy protein. Scientists are studying all three to learn which makes the best tofu.
TL;DR: Tofu consists of soybeans and water that are made into a paste with a binding agent.
Tofu gets harder when you press more water out of it. The tofu industry has sorted tofu’s different hardnesses into three basic types:
Most commercial tofu has one of these labels or a variation. “Medium-firm” or “extra-firm” are popular options.
In the end, though, tofu is a spectrum. The more water you press out, the firmer it gets.
Tofu is soy, which offers a long list of health benefits. For example:
Different types of tofu have different nutrition profiles. For example, firmer tofu has a higher protein content than softer tofu. It’s denser, so it contains more soy per square inch.
You can find specific in the MyFitnessPal app. It might even inspire you to try a new type!
TL;DR: Tofu is good for your heart health and can help your body meet its nutrition needs and build muscle.
Tempeh is another soy-based plant protein. It traditionally comes from Indonesia, where it’s still the most popular soy product.
Making tempeh starts by soaking the soybeans, typically overnight, then boiling, draining, and fermenting them. The boiled soybeans are then mixed with a fungus called Rhizopus oligosporus. Some people call this “tempeh starter.”
The fermentation process takes a day or two. During that time, a white mold grows over the beans. It binds them into a large sheet, which you can cut and cook.
TL;DR: Tempeh is fermented, soaked soybeans made into a solid block.
Tempeh and tofu are both soy-based and worth trying if you’re interested in a plant-based diet and can eat soy. But no, tofu and tempeh are not the same food.
Tempeh is fermented, so it has a different taste and texture. The fermentation process also changes the nutritional profile.
Let’s look at the nutritional difference between tempeh and tofu. Using the MyFitnessPal app, we can compare 3 oz. servings of tempeh and firm tofu.
The tempeh has:
So, in the tempeh vs. tofu protein face-off, tempeh is the clear winner. Tempeh also has more dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin A.
But nutrients aren’t the only consideration. Tempeh has a stronger taste. It’s known for its bold and nutty flavor, while tofu is famously neutral and takes on a dish’s highlight flavors.
TL;DR: Tempeh or tofu? Tempeh wins for protein and contains more carbs than tofu. It also has a stronger taste.
A 3 oz. serving of tempeh contains:
Most of the fat in tempeh is unsaturated, with a ratio of about two grams of unsaturated to one gram of saturated. There are no trans fats.
If you have celiac disease — or any gluten intolerance — you’ll want to skip this section. But if your body is okay with wheat, it’s time to try seitan, a vegan protein made from wheat gluten.
You get seitan by extracting the gluten from wheat and mixing it with water. Add some spices, and voilà! Seitan.
Protein from gluten. Who knew?
Turns out, the ancient Chinese. Legend says Buddhist monks created seitan in the sixth century CE. Even then, it was a way to eat healthier without missing out on the benefits of meat.
Seitan’s texture is so much like chicken that some people call it “wheat meat.” It’s perfect if you want a food like tofu without tofu’s silky mouthfeel. It also makes a good substitute for tempeh if a nutty taste isn’t your favorite.
The main downside? Seitan doesn’t include lysine, an essential amino acid. Technically, that means seitan isn’t a complete protein. But don’t worry, it’s still healthy — you just need other sources of proteins, too.
TL;DR: Seitan is essentially wheat gluten, usually with spices added.
Seitan is a processed food, meaning it’s altered from its natural state. To create seitan, you must extract the gluten from its natural state within the wheat.
That said, some seitan is more processed than others. Store-bought seitan includes more preservatives so it can reach you safely.
You can also buy flavored seitan. Those products might contain sauces with added sugar, oils, and other ingredients. Always check the ingredients list for what kind of seitan you’re buying and what’s been added.
If you want minimally processed seitan, your best bet is making it at home. The primary ingredient is vital wheat gluten, which you can buy in specialty stores.
TL;DR: Store-bought seitan is usually processed, but you can make it at home.
A 3.5 oz. serving of seitan contains:
The closest comparison, meat substitute-wise, is tempeh vs. seitan. Tempeh has slightly less protein, fewer carbs, and less fat.
Compared to tofu, seitan has significantly more protein. Tofu contains 7.6 g per 3.5 oz. serving. Seitan also has more carbs, making it a trade-off for some people.

So, seitan vs. tofu vs. tempeh. Two are soy-based, and one is wheat-based. All are versatile and have similar macro profiles. Which to choose?
As with most things food-related, it depends on you. Your nutrition needs should determine your choice of meat substitute. Of course, your sense of taste can play a part, too.
Meat alternatives absorb the flavor of whatever you cook them with. They’re kind of famous for it. Prepare any of these proteins with your favorite herbs and spices, et voilà — customized protein.
Prepare tempeh, tofu, or seitan with your favorite herbs and spices. Instant customized protein! And download MyFitnessPal for more plant-based recipe inspiration.

She is also an RYT-200 yoga teacher and NASM CPT personal trainer.
Ms. Feller owns Maya Feller Nutrition, where her team focuses on the provision of culturally responsive medical nutrition therapy for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mood disorders, and disordered eating. She is author of Eating from Our Roots: 80+ Healthy Home-Cooked Favorites from Cultures Around the World (goop Press), and Co-Host of Well, Now Podcast, Slate’s new wellness podcast.
Semaglutide or GLP-1 medications—like Ozempic and Wegovy—are all the rage in the weight loss community these days.
Not only are people all over social media touting the weight loss benefits, prescriptions for diabetes drugs and similar obesity medication may be up as much as 300 percent over the last few years, according to one report.
As for what to eat while on semaglutide, well, we just released a GLP-1 Nutrition Plan in the MyFitnessPal app dedicated just to that. But because the medication can make you feel fuller faster, you’ll likely eat smaller portions, which means you want to get the most bang for your buck in terms of nutrition. That’s why many experts recommend eating a well-balanced diet for the best results.
But what exactly does that mean? While there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, there are some general guidelines on what to eat while on Ozempic or any other semaglutide medications.
We spoke with registered dietitian and MyFitnessPal Scientific Advisor Maya Feller , MS, RD, CDN who shared some of the foods that may be most helpful.
1. Bone broth
Bone broth pulls double duty as both a protein source and a hydration source. DrFeller recommends drinking 8 ounces a day as part of your daily liquid intake.
Because bone broth contains electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium, it may help keep you hydrated better than plain water, one study shows.
2. Dates
“I really believe people who enjoy sweets should have them, in a mindful and intentional way, if they want to” Feller says. “It makes us all happier.”
To satisfy that sugary craving, she recommends dates. They’re a good source of fiber high in fiber and may not spike your blood sugar as much as other dried fruits, when consumed in moderation. .
One thing to note: If you’re dealing with early satiety, Feller advises limiting how many dates you’re snacking on at a time. “Potein is very important,” she explains, “so don’t fill up on dates and miss out on that important macronutrient.”
3. Tofu
Protein is an essential macronutrient for everyone, including those who are on semaglutide. Dr. Feller is a big fan of plant protein in particular, pointing out that most Americans aren’t eating nearly enough plants on a day-to-day basis.
She likes tofu as a healthy plant-based protein source. According to the USDA, a half-cup serving of tofu has about 22 grams of protein.
Along with all of the benefits of protein—like better bone health and appetite regulation—tofu has also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease and help lower cholesterol.

4. Seafood
Not only is seafood another good source of lean protein, it also contains polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Studies have shown these PUFAs to have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help prevent health conditions like arthritis and cardiovascular disease. They can also support immune health  and lower blood pressure.
As for what specific seafood is best? Dr. Feller says whatever is accessible and affordable will do, whether that’s shrimp, salmon, or any other kind of fish. The key is to choose seafood that is as close to its unadulterated form as possible, with minimal added sugar, salt, or fat.
5. Summer Squash and cucumbers
Staying hydrated while on semaglutide medications is important. And while drinking water is an easy way to do that, you can also rehydrate by eating certain foods.
Dr. Feller suggests adding more vegetables with a high water content—like cucumbers, zucchini, and other summer squashes—into your diet. Not only will these provide you with more fluid to help with digestion, they also have some nutritional value. Win-win.
6. Cruciferous vegetables
Dr. Feller likes cruciferous veggies like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, or Brussels sprouts primarily for the gut health benefits. They contain certain compounds that can promote the growth of healthy gut bacteria and balance your microbiome. Some research has shown this may reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, too.
They’re also high in fiber, which can help improve digestion and keep you regular. This is especially important when you’re taking Ozempic, which slows your digestive system and increases how long it takes food and waste to exit your body.
If you’re taking a semaglutide medication like Ozempic—or plan to in the future—and need more guidance, check out MyFitnessPal’s new 7-day GLP-1 Nutrition Plan. It provides expert-backed tools and techniques to help you achieve sustainable weight loss through healthier habits. Whether that’s learning how to determine your protein needs or how to eat more fiber on the daily, our plan can help you hit your goals.
