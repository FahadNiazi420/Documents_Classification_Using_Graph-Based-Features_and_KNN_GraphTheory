I had no family in fashion whatsoever, but I remember sitting in front of my family’s desktop during my freshman year of high school and searching for editorials. I didn’t even know that word; I was typing phrases like ‘photography with dresses’ or ‘makeup on models.’ My style slowly started to change as I did more research. I got into thrifting during my senior year, and it was through hunting for vintage pieces—and learning how to authenticate them—that I knew fashion was going to be a part of my life somehow. Even so, I ended up going to college to become a teacher. Education is so important to me, and I thought maybe I could have the best of both worlds by teaching fashion or even just by being a teacher with great style. [Laughs]
When I graduated college, a few doors in my personal life closed, which gave me an opportunity to completely change the trajectory of my life. I loved New York so much and knew that if I didn’t move then, I would never get the chance again. I was terrified because I didn’t have a job, but through a friend of a friend of a friend, I found someone that was looking for a roommate in the East Village.
CAREER
When I first got to the city, I met with an employment agency—it was very 'Sex and The City.' All of the agents were wearing hot pink stilettos. I walked in with my resume and met with someone for maybe 10 minutes. As soon as she looked at it—I will never forget this—she said, ‘It says that you want to be a freelance stylist, that you want to work in editorial, that you want to have personal clients. It seems like your goal is to be the next Rachel Zoe. Well, unfortunately, the best job that we can give you would be at a chain retail store. I see hundreds of girls that want the exact same thing. Please don’t take this the wrong way, but it’s not going to happen for you.’ I don’t know what came over me, but I said, ‘Well, I’m going to prove you wrong.’ I was shaking and grabbed my resume and left. Then I cried all of the way home.
I used a few connections and got a job working retail at Intermix and later Helmut Lang. Those two years were so hard because I thought I was regressing. I was like, ‘I did this in Dallas. There’s no way I left my entire family to do the exact same thing.’ But I had no idea how to be a freelancer.

I later met Carly Cardellino, who was Cosmopolitan’s beauty director, through mutual friends at church, and I explained what I wanted to do. I said, ‘I don’t know what that means for you and how you could help me, but I’ll do anything and I’ll do it for free.’ Around that time, I was interning for stylist Sabina Schreder, so I got to help style people like Blake Lively and Scarlett Johansson for magazine covers. Carly told me to send her my profile, and I did. But I didn’t hear from anybody for a month. I was convinced they hated it, and I was so embarrassed. But what was happening was that someone bumped up my profile to the central Hearst team. One day, I got a call saying, ‘Sorry for the delay. Everyone loved your portfolio. We have a shoot coming up with Revlon in collaboration with Elle and Cosmopolitan. You would need to style 10 models. Is that something you’re comfortable with?’ I was like, ‘Of course. I shoot 10 models often.’ Complete lie. [Laughs] I had three weeks to put it together. I didn’t have access to publicists to pull clothing, so I called my ex-bosses at Intermix and Helmut Lang and they pretty much let me ransack their stores. It was a huge success, and from that moment on, I was contracted by Hearst for about five years, which later led to lookbooks and campaigns with brands like Kate Spade, CoverGirl, Neutrogena, J. Crew, and Coach. My work has appeared in other magazines like Vogue, Glamour, and L’Officiel, too. On the non-editorial end, I work with 10 people, including CEOs, founders, and authors, on a personal styling basis.
I later picked up film and digital photography because I needed to show my own personal work. It was a hobby at first, but it’s now a part of my work, too. I shoot a lot with Babba Canales, one of my styling clients and the founder of hair care brand Ceremonia.
BEAUTY
I have a very personal relationship with beauty through my mom, who is the beauty icon in my life. She always had big, curly hair—and now I love blowouts. She loves long red nails, and those are now my signature. She started dancing Mexican traditional ballet folklórico when she was five years old, so she grew up wearing makeup from a very young age. She still beats her face every single day, like cannot leave the house without her makeup. But when she had me, she wanted me to resist the pressure that she was under, so I wasn’t allowed to wear makeup until my senior year of high school. That’s a tough thing when you’re in it. [Laughs] I would put on mascara when I got to school in the morning, and then on the bus ride home, I would use wipes to take it off. At this point, I’ve learned what works for me and what I like, and so I’ve created a sort of uniform for myself. I keep it classic and then a little something—like a darker lip—if I’m going out.
SKINCARE
When I started building a routine, I felt like I had just been dropped off on Earth. There’s so much information out there, and it can be really contradictory, so I went to a Kiehl’s store for a skin consultation because I wanted someone to explain every product, step by step.
I don’t wash my face in the mornings. Maybe I’ll splash some water on it, but after that, I just put Aquaphor on my face when I wake up. It makes my face feel and look like silk. Well, every once in a while, I’ll add in the Kiehl's Avocado Eye Cream—which is really good under makeup—and the Daily Reviving Concentrate Oil, but usually, it’s just Aquaphor. If I’m going outside, I’ll put on sunscreen of course. I use the Super Fluid UV Defense Facial SPF. It’s super light and a little tinted—but not as pigmented as a tinted moisturizer—so it doesn’t leave behind a white film. I love that it doesn’t have a scent, too.

At night, I use the Ultra Facial Cleanser. It’s a no-frills classic and gets the job done. If I have heavy makeup on, I’ll get it off first with the Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil. It really breaks everything down. Then I do a layer of the Cucumber Herbal Toner. The way they described toners to me is that cleansers are the equivalent of sweeping a floor but toners are the equivalent of mopping. I love this one because it’s alcohol-free. Then I pat on the Midnight Recovery Concentrate Face Oil. It’s supposed to make you look more radiant.
If my skin is feeling really dry, I’ll use the Ultra Facial Overnight Face Mask. I love it because it’s clear—it looks like I'm just putting Aquaphor on—and I can easily rinse it off in the morning. My skin always feels so good after. I also love Sonsie’s Multi Moisture Mask. It’s so easy to travel with.
Since we’re in New York and I don’t know what’s hitting my face when I’m walking down the street, I always have Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay at home. But I probably only use it once a month because it’s very powerful and I don’t want to dry out my skin even more. It really makes me feel like I’m bringing out all of the pollution and yuckiness that’s trapped in my pores.
My Mount Lai Jade Gua Sha broke so I need to get a new one, but we all want to highlight the things that we like about our face right? I like my cheekbones, but I’m 36 years old, so I don’t know how much longer I have with them. [Laughs] The gua sha helps me draw them out. Normally—when it’s not broken—I use it every other day for the length of three songs with one of my Kiehl’s face oils. I’ve tried it with Aquaphor and that was fine, but the face oils give me more of a slip to work with.

MAKEUP 
When it comes to makeup, a big priority for me is to make sure that it’s as natural as possible. I have pretty dark eye circles, so I like to use both Revlon’s ColorStay 5-in-1 Concealer in shade 002 Universal Brightener and Make Up For Ever’s HD Skin Smooth & Blur Undetectable Under Eye Concealer in shade 2.5(N) Desert under my eyes. I apply a very thin layer. My mom has pretty dark eye circles—and her mom did, too—and I’m trying to embrace those similarities in our family. Overall, I’m in an era of embracing all parts of myself. I like that I can look in the mirror and see my grandmother and my mom.
I’ve really been loving Saie’s Dew Blush in Spicy and Rosy. These blushes feel like more of a tint to me, although they’re very buildable if you want more pigment. Tower 28 has a great shade of their BeachPlease Cream Blush called Rush Hour, too. For a seamless look, sometimes I brush on a bit of the blush on my eyelids. But recently, I’ve been using Merit’s Solo Shadows, especially the Midcentury shade. They have a cream-to-powder formula that makes it easy for girls like me who don't necessarily know what they’re doing when it comes to blending eyeshadow. [Laughs] I don’t find Chanel’s Les 4 Ombres Multi-Effect Quadra Eyeshadow palettes intimidating either. I love the 266 Tissé Essentiel and 334 Modern Glamour versions. Tom Ford’s Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow Palette in De La Créme is great, too. I especially love that the palettes have four colors, so it takes the guesswork out of picking colors to combine.
I have thinner, lighter lashes, and I’m trying to embrace that, but I do love Merit’s Clean Lash Mascara. I also don’t pluck or wax my brows because they’re already kind of thin. I recently found the e.l.f. Wow Brow Gel in Deep Brown at Target. It’s easy and to the point—and it doesn’t add too much product.
On an average day, I stick to my Lucas Papaw Ointment for my lips, or Gucci’s Hydrating Lip Balm in Joslyn Clair is great if I want an elevated lip balm. For color, I really like Merit’s Tinted Lip Oil in Falcon and Sangria—Sangria especially stains the lips for hours. My absolute go-to is Makeup by Mario’s MoistureGlow Plumping Lip Serum in Honey Glow. I have one in my errands bag and in my makeup bag; you’ll never catch me without one. Every once in a while, I love a red lipstick like Armani’s Lip Magnet Liquid Lipstick in Hollywood. Chanel has really good reds too. I feel like when I wear a Chanel red—I love the Rouge Allure Laque in Invincible—I’m always like, ‘Take a photo of this please. I need everyone to see.’
HAIR
In college, I shaved the sides of my head. My hair was bleached red and black, too. I’m so grateful that I was able to survive that era of my life. [Laughs] At this point, I think I have virgin hair again. I let it air dry as much as possible, but I do get a blowout every two weeks. I like big hair—I’ll always have that little bit of Texas in me. I go to this little hole-in-the-wall in Chinatown that charges me like $24. The girls spend 10 minutes massaging you. It’s amazing, but I’m sorry, I’m gatekeeping the name because it’s that incredible. I’ve been going there for five years now. And twice a year, I make a trip up to the Upper East Side to get my hair trimmed by Diana Barbaros at Kolor Bar. Since I'm short, I have to make sure that my hair doesn't also pull me down, so I try to make sure that the layers are higher up to kind of elongate my body.

I have a great relationship with the brand Ceremonia because it's founded by Babba Canales. I remember when this was just an idea, so to see it fully in Sephora is so special. I really like the Champú de Yucca because it’s good for dry hair—and my hair is very dry. It smells incredible, too. Sometimes I’ll use the Guava Leave-In-Conditioner as a sort of mask. I’ll put it in for a few minutes and then rinse it out. I’ll use the Aceite de Moska before washing my hair every once in a while, too. It’s a scalp oil that’s meant to help with flakiness and frizz.
As far as post-washing and styling go, my absolute favorite Ceremonia products are the Pequi Curl Activator and the Style Refresher. I like to use the Pequi Curl Activator on the last four days before I wash it. It’s great because it does activate your curls, but the serum doesn’t harden or grease up your hair. It’s not like a gel, where your hair automatically sets or starts to flake. After I’ve slept on my hair like this, I just spray the Refresher to reset my curls. Similarly, OUAI’s Wave Spray is really great. I use this a lot at the beach or after I get out of a pool if I want to keep my waves. OUAI’s Hair Oil is so good, too. You only need a tiny amount and it gets rid of your fly-aways.
NAILS 
Every two weeks, I go to Cobble Hill Nails & Spa for dip powder, which I love because I deal with hangers a lot and dip makes my nails so strong. I don’t do anything to them in between appointments. If anything, I might use Aquaphor on my cuticles. I always go with red nails because the color goes with everything. Red stands the test of time between seasons and allows me to focus my creativity around styling my personal clients or curating looks for editorials.
FRAGRANCE
When it comes to fragrances, I’m drawn towards woodsy, masculine, darker scents. I've always been that way. Similar to my style, I think of scent as a uniform—once I find something that I like, I will not leave it.
I would drink Byredo’s Super Cedar in a cocktail glass if I could. It makes me feel really confident. In New York, we’re in such close quarters on the streets and in the restaurants, so we always smell the same scents, but I don’t smell Super Cedar often—and I want to stand out. When I first moved to New York, I was wearing a different scent—you can probably guess the one—but then everyone got it, and it was too much. When I found Super Cedar, it was a game-changer.
Growing up, the little southern girl in me always wanted to own a Chanel scent, and now I have Paris-Venise. I don't necessarily wear it often, but it's here as a reminder that I can do the things that I always wanted. Ceremonia’s Perfume de la Tierra is really nice, too. It feels musky and reminds me of how it smells after it rains. I love the bottle; it’s so beautiful to style on your vanity.
In college, I wore Burberry’s classic eau de parfum. I don’t wear it now, but I like to smell it so I keep a bottle around. [Laughs] It brings back so many good memories of the time before I came to New York.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:03:54,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/marta-mae-dieux-air-milkshake-beauty/,2873,"“I’m really good at manifesting. When I was growing up in South Jersey, I always knew that I wanted to work in the fashion industry. I was a girly girl—I never wore pants, only dresses, skirts, skorts—and I had this dream of going to the Fashion Institute of Technology. I didn’t even do a campus tour when I applied in high school. I ended up studying textile development because I’m a fabric nerd. After college, I did work in research and development for the first five or six years of my career. I interned at Betsey Johnson, which was iconic because I got to work with the actual Betsey Johnson. And then later I worked for Alice + Olivia, The Jones Group, Polo Ralph Lauren, and Express.
My mom passed away when I was doing R&D for Polo Ralph Lauren’s sleepwear. My boss at the time was going on maternity leave, so I wasn’t offered a proper bereavement and was forced to come back to work the day after the funeral. I thought, ‘Fuck this. Fashion’s not for me. I can’t believe that making pajamas is more important than a 23-year-old grieving her mother.’ I really started to take stock of what was important to me. A few months later, I felt like I needed a creative outlet and a community to keep me going, so I started an Instagram called Hot Girls Eating Pizza in the spring of 2014. I would ask cool women I admired to get pizza. I would literally DM them on Instagram and take them out during my lunch breaks or after work. Over the course of the last decade, I had hundreds and hundreds of pizza dates, which shaped my career and also some of my closest friendships. I met Charlotte Palermino, who co-founded It’s Nice Paper and Dieux with me, through a Hot Girls Eating Pizza date. Dieux specifically came out of an opportunity we saw for a transparent skincare company. Charlotte, Joyce [de Lemos], and I launched Dieux with our Forever Eye Masks in September of 2020 and then released our Deliverance Soothing Serum the following year.
My gifting suite Air Milkshake is the evolution of Hot Girls Eating Pizza. I was introduced to so many people and so many brands through HGEP, and pre-pandemic, I ran some gifting programs for a few brands. I realized there was a big opportunity to take the pizza away and focus on the amazing community I had built and introduce them to new products, brands, and people in a really intentional way. At this point, I’ve worked with some pretty large brands, like Vans and Levi’s. I’ve also worked with brands like Hill House, Vacation, K18, Casper, Fly By Jing, and Houseplant, Seth Rogan’s cannabis company. I’ve had some bad experiences going to other gifting suites where people were judged for how many followers they had. I’ve always believed in micro-influencers and investing in real people who have an engaged community versus just large followings, so the people invited to Air Milkshakes are not always influencers in the ‘traditional’ sense. I have people that come in with 2,000 followers, and I know that their ROI is so much more long-term than a flash in the pan influencer.
I also have a cannabis and lifestyle brand called Angel Therapy with my fiancé Lincoln Barnett and a couple of our friends. Lincoln has worked in cannabis his whole career, and I’ve always wanted to own a weed company. We started it in 2021 and licensed it in both California and New York City. It’s just a fun project right now, but I’m excited to see how it evolves.

SKINCARE
I get facials one to two times a month with Hayat Moubarak at LA Clinic BH or with Cynthia Franco, and I go to FaceGym two to four times a month. I love Kate Rose Teitelbaum in the Santa Monica location and Brooke in the West Hollywood spot. If I have an event coming up, I’ll go every week. I’ve also been getting cosmetic acupuncture from Dr. Toni Weinrit at The Reset: LA. She’s fucking amazing. I was on a 10-week plan with her, which included microneedling every four weeks. After those sessions, I used Sofie Pavit’s Nice Ice Frozen Toner Pods to help with redness. The next day, I glowed like nothing else.
Dr. Loretta’s Gentle Hydrating Cleanser is my favorite cleanser. I’ve been using it for four years now. The smell is so light and it foams up so nicely. To make sure that I get everything off my face, especially when I’ve worn makeup, I’ll follow up with a toner. I’ve used the Clinique Clarifying Lotion 2 my whole life, but if I don’t grab that one, then I’m reaching for Odacité’s Blue Aura Cleansing Water.
Our Dieux Deliverance is my holy grail serum. I am so grateful to have an unlimited supply because I use it very generously, multiple times a day. It’s very calming, so it’s great if you have any sort of irritation. Meanwhile, the Saro de Rúe Freeze Dried Hyaluronic Acid System is fucking amazing too. My friend at Violet Grey gifted it to me a year and a half ago. I wasn’t using hyaluronic acid at the time, but I started to pair the tablets with Deliverance instead of the Pure Activator that it comes with and the results were crazy. My skin was so hydrated. I only use the tablets a couple of times a week since the system is pretty expensive, but it’s such a neat and innovative concept. Sofie Pavitt’s Mandelic Clearing Serum is also fantastic—it really stops a breakout in its tracks.
I’ve been saying that our Dieux Air Angel is my favorite since it launched, but I always go back to our Dieux Instant Angel. I might be biased, but I really think that it’s one of the best moisturizers in the world. I use it liberally and it doesn’t pill, even under my tinted moisturizer. Otherwise, I really love Clinique’s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel. It’s the product I’ve used the longest throughout my life. My mom was such a Clinique freak—one of my earliest memories is of her taking me to the Clinique counter to get a re-up on her Clarifying Lotion 2.

I had a crazy bout of hormonal acne when I turned 28, and it fucking sucked. My chin was especially bad, and I was so grateful for the Starface Pimple Patches. They really helped my confidence. My skin is much better now, but when I have a spot that’s healing, I always reach for the Odacité Le Blue Repair Balm. It really cuts down on healing time.
I was introduced to Agent Nateur through Air Milkshake. The Holi (Bright) Resurface Glass Face Mask is especially good. It’s gentle enough that you can wear it overnight and it’s really helped to even out my skin tone. The only other face mask I’ve been using is Sisley’s Black Rose Cream. My aesthetician Hayat worked with Sisley for 30 years—she was the one who put me on it. It’s really expensive, but I understand why because it’s fucking good—it’s so hydrating.
When it comes to sunscreen, I love Nivea Japan’s Super Water Gel SPF 50 PA+++. It was a Sofie Pavitt recommendation from a few years ago, but it’s been my favorite since. It’s such a nice watery formula that goes on like a serum. The Dr. Loretta Urban Antioxidant Sunscreen SPF 40 goes on really well, too. I always have one in my purse.
I try to use the FaceGym Pure Lift Facial Skincare Tool every night. Their facialists use it during treatments, and I feel like it’s stronger than any other device I’ve used. That said, I also really like the ZIIP Microcurrent Facial Device. I got a facial with the founder, Melanie Simon, over the summer, and it was so cool to have her show me tips and tricks to use it. Instead of the ZIIP Conductive Gel though, I actually use the Lily of the Desert Inner Fillet Aloe Vera Gel for treatments. And then I was given a Current Body LED Face Mask over the summer. Nowadays, I don’t have an extra 20 or 30 minutes to use it every night, but when I use it consistently, I do see a big difference. I’ve also been sleeping with Frownies Non-Invasive Wrinkle Smoothers every night for the past month—I buy the Gentle Lifts for Lip Lines but use them all over my face. They’re these little adhesive patches that you wet with water and stick on your face, and I swear, my fine lines are disappearing before my eyes. You look crazy when you go to bed, but I think they’re magic.

MAKEUP
My cheeks get really red very easily. I’ve learned to embrace my natural flush, so to that end, I’ve never had to use blush. I always default to either a glitter eye or winged cat eye—that’s a skill that I’m proud of. I’ve tried to learn how to do smoky eye a few times, but then I’m always like, ‘When are you actually going to use this?’
I’ve been using the Tarte Amazonian Clay BB Tinted Moisturizer in Medium-Tan for maybe a decade. It really enhances my natural color, and my cheek color still comes through—I just look more ‘alive’ when I wear it. I also like that it has a little bit of SPF, but at this point in my life, I know that it’s not enough to wear it on its own, so I do wear sunscreen underneath it, too. If I need more coverage or have to cover any pimples, I like the NARS Soft Matte Complete Concealer in Custard.
I get my brows tinted and laminated with Yuki at Salon Lepetie, but in between sessions, I like to use the Half Magic Grippie Brow Sculpting Brow Gel for a feathered look. Growing up, I didn’t listen to my mom when she said that brows are so important, so I over-plucked mine. I’ve tried to grow them out with a serum, but it’s just so hard to remember to put it on every night. I just draw in little hairs with the Victoria Beckham Babyblade Brow Pencil in the few bald spots that I can’t get rid of. I usually have a hard time finding the right brow pencil shade because my eyebrows are on the lighter end, but VBB’s Taupe is perfect for me. And then my friend Jade put me onto the Babe Original Pro Lash Separator. Because my lashes are lifted and tinted, I would use disposable separators a lot, which I felt so bad about. The Babe one is just $10, perfectly curves around your whole eye, and truly separates your lashes. It’s amazing.
I was so loyal to Kat Von D’s Tattoo Eyeliner and Stila’s Liquid Liner for years, but I was gifted the Trish McEvoy Liquid Liner Pen and I’ve been loving it this past year. If I don’t use a dark liner though, I’ll use the Victoria Beckham Beauty Brightening Waterline Pencil instead. It’s such a cool product. It’s kind of a throwback to the white eyeliner we would use back in the day, but it really makes your eyes pop.
Victoria Beckham Beauty also makes these great shadow sticks called Eyewear. They’re super pigmented and blend out really well. Macaroon is such a beautiful pink. I love Oyster, a shimmery pearl, too. I blend them out with my fingers. And I’ve been using the Stila Glitter & Glow Shadows since college. Smoky Storm and Gold Goddess are so pretty, and they just glide on. The About-Face Shadowsticks are so easy to use, too. Acidic, an acid green, and 2002, a pearly blue, are my favorite shades. I’ll either do a wing with them or just color in my entire eye and head out the door.
For my lips, Victoria Beckham’s Posh Glosses in Ice, the clear shade, and Fizz, a cool rose, are my favorites. Then I top off whatever I’m wearing with the Caliray Surfproof Setting Spray. I obviously don’t wear a lot of makeup, but it’s so nice to have a spray on hand, especially for eye makeup.

NAILS
I go to Zoe at Red Polish for my nails every four weeks. Julie Schott introduced me to her over the pandemic, so I’ve been going to her for three or four years now. She does the best nail art. At this point, she and I have the type of relationship where if I don’t have a concept in mind, I’ll say, ‘Zoe, it’s your call today.’ I’m always so happy with the results. I’m very girly with my nails though. I love clouds, sparkles, glitter, and hearts.
FRAGRANCE
I had a party to celebrate 10 years of Hot Girls Eating Pizza, and as I was hugging some of my friends—some of whom I haven’t seen in five or six years—they said, ‘You smell like you.’ It’s because I’ve worn the same scent since college: Chloé Eau De Parfum. I love how it smells on me, and I’ve gotten so many compliments on it over the years that I’ll probably never switch. Recently, I’ve been layering it with D.S. & Durga’s I Don’t Know What. I also like to layer it with Milk from DedCool. And there’s this incredible fragrance and candle studio in Brooklyn called Joya. They do the coolest collaborations in the game, including a roll on perfume oil with an experiential hotel in Nashville called Noelle. Sometimes I layer that on, too. It smells like amber and musk, which I tend to gravitate towards.
I get more experimental with fragrance when it comes to candles, but one of my more classic favorites is Maison Louis Marie’s No.04 Bois de Balincourt. It smells so clean. I discovered it at New York Pilates because they always burn it—and I have a really positive association with going to NYP and taking time for myself. I also love all of Joya’s candles, but especially Nightlight, which is their collab with artist Tom Fruin. And my friends have this amazing one-of-one candle brand called Western Disco. They source vessels and make candles with their signature scents, Seabird and Orchard.

HAIR
Jess Gonzalez colors my hair at Benjamin LA. I’ve been going to her for highlights every three months for a year and a half, and I love the way they grow out when Jess does them. She’s somehow able to do them without damaging my hair. For trims and blowouts, I go to Nina Aprile—she has been on a journey with me to get my hair to grow long again. I do a trim with her every three months now, and it’s finally growing long again. I only get three or four blowouts a year now—and always with Nina. I used to get them so often, but my hair was just not in a good place so I mainly air dry now. Nina’s blowouts are my favorite in the world though. She also has an amazing hair brand called That Girl That Did Your Hair. We included her Knotty Brushes in the Air Milkshake suite in New York. I think they’re better than Tangle Teezers. They’re the perfect brushes for smoothing and de-tangling.
I love purple shampoos, but I try not to overdo it with them because I don’t want my hair to get too ashy. It’s really easy to get a little brassy in California though, so I throw a purple shampoo in the mix every third hair wash. Kevin Murphy’s Blonde.Angel.Wash is great. dpHUE also makes an incredible Cool Blonde Shampoo and Conditioner. Jess put me on to the Milbon Moisture Replenishing #6 Treatment, which I use every week. That’s what she uses when she colors my hair. It makes a huge difference with moisture, and I love Milbon in general. California Naturals Shampoo and Conditioner are also in the mix.
I love Agent Nateur’s Holi (Locks) Strengthening Serum and Hair (Silk) Hydrating Serum. I really credit Holi (Locks) especially with helping me grow my hair. It’s an oil that you massage into your scalp. I think the stimulation has been really helpful. I also have an iRestore Essential red light hair mask that’s been really helpful with hair growth and preventing hair loss. I was losing so much hair from stress, and Stacey Bendet, the founder of Alice & Olivia posted about it on Instagram. I was totally influenced. I use it for 30 minutes every day.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:03:56,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/tonya-papanikolov-rainbo-canada-fairy-wedding/,1492,"After three years of hearing about one another from a mutual friend, Tonya Papanikolov met her now-husband Simon Chantry on a blind date in 2017. “He was unlike anybody I had ever dated before, so there was this element of breaking a pattern for me.” says Papanikolov, the founder of medicinal mushroom company, Rainbo. “He was living in Barbados at the time, and when he told me about his line of work, which was all in the cryptocurrency space, it was almost like he was talking in a different language—but he came across as so grounded. There was this beautiful ease, and that has spanned our whole relationship.” Six years later, under the new moon of the 2023 summer solstice, the couple got married on the same Canadian island where Simon proposed. Their friends served as the vendors for the couple’s “fairy fête,” which included a six-foot “forest” cake, mushroom centerpieces, and a performance from the groom. Tonya tells us all about it below.
Dear ITG,
Our mutual best friend, Drummond, had been telling Simon and I about one another for three years, but we were both in relationships. Drum used to say, ‘You two think the same. You’re both out there in terms of your imagination and how kind you are.’ My ears always perked up when I heard his name. I never pursued it, but I thought he sounded awesome. Then in 2017, I went through a big, big breakup. I had a few months to myself before I decided we should meet, which we eventually did, at a wine bar in Toronto called Archive.
It’s funny because on the way to the bar, I remember thinking that I didn’t even know what Simon looked like. I texted Drum, and he said, ‘Walk towards the man with the beautiful curly hair.’ He had told Simon, ‘It’s the beautiful woman with the curly hair.’ When I got there, sure enough, I knew exactly who to approach. After the bar, I took him to my friend Harrison Taylor’s art show. He and his wife, Amanda Laine, who are two of our closest friends, ended up officiating our wedding. There were lots of sweet little ties like this in our wedding, but before we get to that…
I was completely surprised when Simon proposed. There’s an island in Ontario called Prince Edward County where we’ve had a lot of special moments together. It was where we professed our love to one another in 2018, and it was where we got engaged. I thought we were celebrating Simon’s birthday in March of 2021, so the proposal was a complete, complete surprise. We were taking a walk down a pier, and he accidentally hit me across the face with his elbow, so I had all these tears streaming down my face. I think he was nervous, so he just hopped down on one knee and asked. My one eye was tearing uncontrollably, but I was just so happy. It was also a new moon, which he didn’t realize at the time, and these kind of celestial events are important to me. We later decided to get married at The Bright House on the island.
Honestly, we didn’t really start planning until quite a while after our engagement. I started a Pinterest board with inspiration, and the initial board was called ‘Fairy Fête.’ It was very celestial, with photos of fairies and mushrooms and moss and angels. At a certain point, I remember thinking, ‘Am I going to wear fairy wings to my wedding? How fun would that be?’ The board is pretty far out there, but we did land somewhere in that realm—and still called it ‘Fairy Fête.’
Everybody told us our wedding was ‘so us’ and that it was the most uncommon wedding that they had ever attended. Obviously, it was a wedding and we had some traditional aspects, but we really tried to make it our own and to celebrate everyone who played a big role in our love story. Harry and Amanda were at the altar with us—they began the ceremony by leading everyone through a meditation and speaking to the planets that had come into alignment on that day—and we brought Drum out on a leopard couch down the aisle to commemorate being the best man and introducing us. All of our vendors were our friends, too. The music was by Roxy Moon, and we also had a performance by Baby Baby, which is my dear friend Pandora’s band. Even Simon performed. That was a big surprise.
Creating the floral and mushroom arrangements—and the overall decor—was a really fun process with one of my dear friends, Lauren Wilson from Timberlost. We found beautiful vintage Moroccan rugs, which we used for the ceremony, through Mellah in Toronto. I was so thrilled with the mushroom arrangements especially—they’re so beautiful and very much in line with the fairy theme. Even our 6-foot ‘forest cake,’ which was actually a strawberry shortcake, had real mushrooms, fresh flowers, and some tree and plant shrubs on it. Natalie Korac made it, and on top of looking amazing, it really was the most delicious cake I’ve ever had. And actually, we have a Rainbo product called Forest Juice. It’s maple syrup infused with mushrooms, so as a gift for everyone, we gave everyone a bottle. Simon and I’s nickname for each other is ‘sweets.’ Everybody calls us ‘The Sweets’ now, so we called the syrup Sweets Juice as a play on Forest Juice.
The savory food came from Emma’s Eatery by Emma Moore. I’ve worked with her before, and you feel like you’re eating nourishing food that’s made for a small group of people. Among the menu, we had salmon, steak, fingerling potatoes, and grilled vegetables. It was all gluten-free, dairy-free and cooked in olive oil, and it really did have the most delicious home-cooked meal feel.
My dress was a custom combination of two gowns from Newhite, and I had a celestial star veil from Ofrenda—it was the one piece that I knew I wanted when I got married. I wore a silk hairband from Aura Eire, star earrings from Jennifer Behr, and pearls from Chan Luu. Simon is a really big man—he’s like 6’4”—and he has a very particular style, so he designed his beautiful wool jacket and collared shirt himself. He wore a bolo tie with my face on it, which was hilarious.
For my beauty look, I just wanted to look very natural and dewy with a little bit of sparkle and shimmer. Romy Zack did both my makeup and hair and absolutely got it right. She used a lot of Saie products, including the Slip Tint, Glowy Super Gel, Glow Sculpt Blush, and Glossybounce Lip Oil in Kiss, to achieve the look.
I always wear sandalwood oil, so I did wear that, but in terms of my signature scent, it’s a secret. It’s an obscure one that everybody would copy when I was younger, so at a certain point I decided to stop telling people.
I didn’t do a whole lot of ‘prep’ ahead of the wedding. I did two microneedling appointments and a Pure Glow facial at Pure + Simple and a Forma treatment at Tight Clinic, but what I really wanted to focus on was more so for a radiant body in terms of my own energy. I already practice a lot of Kundalini yoga, but Simon and I did a five-class rebirthing workshop. We’re both such busy entrepreneurs, and we wanted to move into the next phase of our relationship as consciously as possible, to take a moment to slow down and digest what this meant for our relationship and the vows that we were saying to one another, and to put an end to any of the old programming from the past.
Overall, it was the most beautiful day. As we read our vows to each other, our guests had their jaws open because the sun started shining, the wind stopped, and even the birds began chirping. There were all of these beautiful little things that happened in the moments of speaking our vows. It was like time kind of stood still in this instant of saying these profound words to one another—and that’s a moment that really stays with me.

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:03:58,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/jackie-shuya-tan-instagram-model-beauty-routine/,1114,"“I love my job. I’m a creative editor for Instagram’s own account, @instagram, which means I work with creators and other creatives to feature them and their work. Outside of that, I’m also a model. I’ve done a lot of work for beauty brands like Kosas and Peach and Lily, as well as some runway. I just walked for Rui Zhou, and I walked for Kim Shui, Pronounce, and Eckahus Latta in the past.
Through my job, I go to a lot of events, but I also love to eat, so my perfect night out is eating out with my friends and having a laugh. I love Chinese food. Che Li is really good. Uluh on 9th and 2nd Avenue is also great. If it’s not Chinese, I like going to Commerce Inn. It has an old school British vibe. Buvette and I Sodi are also in the rotation. And I really love Ha’s Đặc Biệt. It’s a pop-up. They just did a month-long one at Gem. It’s some of the best food in New York City.
For a late night out, my friends and I are going to Basement or Paragon in Bushwick. Then, if I want a snack when I’m home, I usually have pizza. There’s 2 Bros and Village Square. I also love the vegan burger and waffle fries from Jerrell’s Betr Brgr. They have a vegan cookies and cream shake that’s amazing. It’s made with oat milk, but it tastes just like a normal milkshake.

SKINCARE
I do a full skincare routine before I go out. The first thing I use is Biologique Recherche’s micellar water, followed by their cleansing milk VIP O2. The cleansing milk has a great slip, so I like to use my gua sha with it. Double cleansing has been great for me. My pores look a lot smaller since I started doing it. Then I use either Aēsop’s Lucent Facial Concentrate, which is a really good vitamin C, or Ranu’s Copper Brightening Serum, which my facialist, Kristyn Smith, recommended. I also really like Biologique Recherche’s Oligo-Protéines Marines for brightening. And I love their Amniotique VG Sérum for hydration and the Lotion P50 PIGM 400 for exfoliating. I feel like my face looks tighter after I use it. For eye cream, I really like Officine Universelle Buly’s Vide Poche. It has more of a serum consistency and comes in a roll-on.
I love how the Sulwhasoo Ginseng Cream smells. I grew up drinking and eating ginseng, so I love having it in my beauty products, too. Also, the texture is really good—it’s worth the price tag. If it’s still light out, I’ll put on my La Mer SPF 50 on my face and neck. I know some people love La Mer and others don’t like it at all, but I’ve tried other sunscreens, and this one is my favorite. It doesn’t leave a white cast. Then, if I’m wearing a dress, I’ll put on Kiehl’s Whipped Body Butter. It’s really hydrating and makes your skin look so fresh.

MAKEUP
Whenever I go out, I have to have lip liner. I love Charlotte Tilbury lip liner in Pillow Talk. Then I add a little bit of the Dior Addict Lip Glow in 12 Rosewood. It has more of a balm consistency, and I like it because it’s light. If I want lip gloss on top, I wear Fenty Beauty’s Lip Luminizer in Fenty Glow Heat. You should definitely use it if you want your lips to be plump, which I love. It stings a little, but it’s manageable.
I use concealer very sparingly, but if I need to cover up a blemish, I like the Radiant Creamy Concealer from NARS. I use shade M2 Ginger. It’s so light and never cakey. I also love Pat McGrath’s Skin Fetish Highlighter & Balm Duo. I use the Bronze version. It’s a stick, so it’s really easy to use and carry with you. The highlighter adds the perfect touch of sparkle on my cheekbones, and sometimes I’ll run the balm on my eyelids for a dewy vibe. If I want actual eyeshadow, I use Dior’s Backstage Palette in 002 Cool Neutrals. I blend it all with my fingers. The fewer tools, the better.
The only curler that works for my super straight lashes is the one from Shu Uemura. And I only use brown eyeliner. I don't like using black; it’s too intense. I’ve gotten all of my makeup tips from my friends, and one of them told me that Asians should only use brown eyeliner. I don’t even really know why. He’s also Asian and really into makeup, so I do what he tells me. Dior’s liquid eyeliner is my favorite.

HAIR
I usually wash my hair once a week. I like Oribe’s Signature Shampoo and Conditioner. I love the smell, and they make my hair feel luscious. Their Gold Lust Nourishing Hair Oil is my go-to for my ends—I never apply it on my roots—but I also love the Huile Magique d'Argan Bio from Le Jardin de Sidi B. It’s an argan oil I picked up from Morocco. My hair is naturally very straight—I don’t own a straightener—so I just go with it. I just brush it through with a wild boar bristle brush from Officine Universelle. I also use one of their Architect combs to do my center part.
FRAGRANCE
I like feminine perfumes with a twist. Like, I want a floral but not straight on. Byredo’s Inflorescence has that vibe. It has rose petals, lily of the valley, and magnolia, but it’s not overly sweet. I also wear Gold Leaves from Régime des Fleurs. It’s very unique, still floral but it also has amber and cardamom. Angeli di Firenze from Santa Maria Novella is also really nice, but that one’s more fruity. When it comes to candles, I turn to Hawthorne, which was co-founded by one of my friends. I really love Aromatic and Woody and Botanic Blur. Otherwise, I’m burning Ptolemy Aromatique from Aēsop.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:01,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/gabriella-khalil-palm-heights-beauty-routine/,1749,"“I founded Palm Heights in Grand Cayman in 2019, and I’m now the Creative Director. I do a little bit of everything, from curating the guest experience to organizing the event programming. When I’m in Cayman, my nights out are almost always at Palm Heights. Sometimes I might have some friends in town, but typically, I’m hosting events for our guests. I hosted a beautiful dinner on the beach to celebrate International Women’s Day with an amazing group of 20 women earlier this month. We also throw our ‘Iconic Ball’ every year to launch the season. Last year, I produced the whole event on our rooftop. We had Mya perform, which was pretty iconic. I wore Christopher John Rogers and danced all night. And every Saturday, Paradise Pizza, our little pizza spot, throws an event called the Mambo Italiano that turns into a huge karaoke party. It’s hot out, but everyone gets really dressed up and goes crazy.
I moved to New York from London a year and a half ago, so I’m still discovering the city. Nights out here mean going to really nice dinners with my friends. I love going to The Grill. I worked on Habibi, so I’ve had a lot of nights out there. Frenchette is good, too. They have the best natural wine. New York is cool because it’s spontaneous. Someone will be like, ‘Let’s pop over there.’ It’s so fun.
SKINCARE
My look tends to be the same, whether I’m heading to a work event or to a great dinner or to a party with my friends. I want to look natural but glowy, and bronzy with full lips. If I have time, I like to start off with a 111Skin rose gold mask and the Sephora Collection roller. Sometimes I’ll only use 111Skin’s eye patches. Both the face masks and eye patches give your skin a nice lift.
Lesse’s Regeneration Mist is so refreshing. I like to spray it on my face and body. But I use Epi.Logic’s Even Balance Toner a lot, especially after a long night. I’m obsessed with Biologique Recherche’s Serum Extraits Tissulaires, too. I really see a difference when I don’t use it. My skin feels drier and just off. I recently started using In Fiore’s Veloutée Complexe. It’s this really light eye and lip serum. Makeup goes on so smoothly after I use it, but it’s also great before going to sleep. Then, if I want a lighter moisturizer, I grab Dermalogica’s Active Moist. But if I need something a little heavier, I like Lesse’s Essential Moisturizer.
Soft Service’s Buffing Bar is amazing. I use it if I want to feel really fresh. Out of the shower, I love Nécessaire’s body lotion. It’s easy and really hydrating. I usually use the unscented one, but I like the eucalyptus one, too. I also use Nécessaire’s deodorant. I go back and forth between that one and Salt & Stone’s black rose and oud deodorant. I was really shy about using natural deodorants for a long time. I felt like they weren’t going to work so I didn’t want to chance it, but I even use them in Cayman now. And I have to say that the Soft Services Theraplush hand cream is so good—I use it every night.

MAKEUP
I’ve used Bobbi Brown’s Full Cover Concealer in Natural Tan for years. True to its name, it gives you great coverage, but it’s also not cakey. It’s great under my eyes. If I want a proper foundation, I use Youngblood’s Liquid Mineral Foundation in Golden Tan (Neutral). Someone recommended it when I lived in London. I’ve always had breakouts, and this helps cover them. But I’m trying not to go so heavy with product, so I’m testing Ciele’s tint now. It’s been good so far. It’s great because it has SPF in it. I use 05 Medium.
I only contour if I’m going out, never during the day. I like Bobbi Brown’s Skin Cream Foundation Stick. I use Cool Golden C076 on my forehead, cheeks, a little bit on my nose, and under my chin. I go very, very light-handed with it. I love makeup that’s easy, and this stick is definitely easy. I blend it out with Sephora Collection’s #78 brush. Then I use the NARS Laguna Bronzing Powder with Sephora Collection’s #50 powder brush. I’ve used Laguna for such a long time—I was devastated recently because I dropped one in Cayman, and it shattered into a million pieces. I set it with Charlotte Tilbury’s setting powder—I use 2 Medium. It’s a nice powder to keep in your purse. And then I’ve been trying Ciele’s blush in the shade Kirsty, a warm nude. I use one tiny dot, and it looks really natural. It has SPF, too.

I’ve also used the Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick in Bronze for years and years. I love to put it on my nose, and I don’t know why but I also highlight my chin a bit. Sometimes I like to use it as eyeshadow during the day. It plays with the light well and gives you this really beautiful sparkle. I got the Chanel Transparent Baume Essentiel as a gift, and I like it on my cheekbones, especially when I’m at Palm Heights and want more of that just-spent-time-on-the-beach glow. I wasn’t expecting to like it honestly, but it’s so soft. I brought the Saie Glow Super Gel—I have the Starglow shade—down to Cayman with me recently, and it was really nice. You can put it all over, even on your collarbones, and it makes you look so healthy.
Makeup by Mario’s Original Master Mattes palette is my new favorite eyeshadow, and I have a ton of palettes, so that’s saying a lot. It has every color you need. I have three of them, one in my work bag, one at Palm Heights, and one at my apartment. And I’m a big eyebrow person, but I hate overdoing them. Glossier’s Boy Brow really works for me because it’s simple and deposits just the right amount of color. I brush it through with a spoolie. Benefit’s They're Real! mascara is my favorite. There’s literally none left in the tube right now. I have thick lashes, and some volumizing mascaras make my lashes really clumpy but this one doesn’t. I buy it over and over.
For my lips, I’m a straight Charlotte Tilbury girl. I love the Lip Cheat liner in Foxy Brown and the Lip Lustre Gloss in Seduction. I have her lipstick in Very Victoria, too. Someone told me it’s named after Victoria Beckham. I go between this one and the Kim K.W. shade. I’m obsessed with that color. A makeup artist introduced me to it. I’ll do all three—liner, lipstick, and gloss—if I really want to go for it, but sometimes I skip the lipstick and only do liner and gloss. It depends on my mood. Oh, and as I’m getting ready, nothing works as good as Vaseline to prep your lips. You can’t beat it.
Even though it’s hot in Cayman, my makeup holds up without setting spray. That’s good, because I hate how setting spray feels. I’m more concerned with taking off excess oil. I carry Clean & Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets with me. Old school.

HAIR
My hair is naturally wavy and big, but I like to wear it dead straight most of the time. I use the Drybar straightening iron. I have a Dyson hair dryer, too, but I have a lot of hair and it takes a long time to dry it, so I like to prolong my straightened hair as long as I can. I think using good products helps. I just started using Anablue. They have a hair serum and a treatment oil, but their scalp cleanser is fantastic. I use it once a week in place of shampoo. I’m obsessed with washing my hair—I really like the feeling of it—and the cleanser is a good addition. It smells great. And I love David Mallett’s serum #DM027—Hannan Siddique cuts my hair at David’s salon in New York. It makes your hair so shiny. Charlotte Mensah also makes a great Manketti hair oil. I use it right out of the shower. And L’Oreal’s Elnett satin hairspray is an OG. It’s the best.
NAILS
I’m very simple and kind of boring when it comes to my nails. Sometimes I’ll switch it up, but I tend to go for neutral colors like Essie’s Ballet Slippers. I used to go for darker shades like dark brown or deep purple and I would get gel manicures, but when I had my daughter—she’s six now—I didn’t want to deal with the upkeep anymore. I feel like it doesn’t matter if my polish chips when I have a neutral shade because it’s less noticeable. That said, if I want to get a gel manicure now for a special occasion, I go to Naomi Yasuda. She’s incredible. Otherwise, I’ll pop in wherever for regular polish.
FRAGRANCE
Costa Brazil’s Aroma is my favorite perfume. It’s woody and smoky. It has amber, which I love, even in candles. It’s also refillable—I’m actually all out of my current bottle—and the container is so unique. I was devastated when the brand was rumored to be closing. I go back and forth between that one and L'Artisan Parfumeur’s Bois Des Sables. It’s this amazing rose and pepper scent that I found in Paris. I love unexpected combinations like this.
In an ideal world, I’m lighting a candle to set the mood for the night—but I usually don’t. I like Byredo Fleur Fantôme a lot, and of course, I have our Palm Heights candle, which has amber, too. Costa Brazil’s Jungle is the best candle ever. It’s so luxurious, vegan, and smells like the heart of the Amazon.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:03,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/hannah-baxter-beauty-editor-career-skincare/,3321,"Once in a blue moon, ITG encounters a Top Shelf so rich that just one Top Shelf won’t do. Hannah’s decade-long beauty career puts her in this rare category. So today, read up on her career path and detail-oriented skincare routine. Tomorrow, she’s getting into makeup—and everything else.
“I grew up in St. Louis, Missouri—Karlie Kloss and Jon Hamm are our pride and joy—but I always knew that New York was the goal. My great Aunt Ruth, who’s my favorite person in the world and the most fabulous woman, lived here for over 70 years. She was married three times. She traveled the world. She booked talent for cruise ships. She used to buy weed from Dizzy Gillespie. I idolized her growing up. We would visit her every summer, so I knew that I would end up here and become a writer. I went to Mizzou, University of Missouri, and started off as a journalism major. I quickly realized it wasn’t for me when I had a class where the professor said, ‘If you want to do anything in creative writing, change your major now.’ So I did, and I ended up studying English and theater with an emphasis in playwriting.
CAREER
I moved to New York in 2013 and split my time between bartending and theater development, which is asking the government for money for the arts. It was soul crushing, but I got to see a lot of theater for free. At a certain point, I started applying for a million jobs at Condé Nast and Hearst—there’s probably some cyberspace place with 5,000 resumes that I sent in—but I wasn’t making any headway. Then I applied for a fellowship with Bust magazine. I learned about it from reading Tina Fey’s biography, Bossypants, and how they assured her they would retouch her armpit stubble but nothing else, which I thought was really cool. I later became their digital editor and was there for a year and a half.
When I joined Coveteur, I was definitely more of a generalist covering a little bit of everything, but I was really attracted to what was happening in beauty at the time. This was around 2015. I was reading Into The Gloss and xoJane—RIP—and really liked that they were publishing a different type of beauty coverage. When Katie Jayne Becker, my former boss and now one of my best friends, became the beauty director, she helped guide me and nurture my love of beauty. I stayed at Coveteur for five years before going to The Zoe Report, where I was the deputy beauty editor. I was there for almost two years, and it was such a wonderful experience.

Going freelance was a very big decision. I’ve spoken to some editor friends who did something similar, and we all agreed that there’s this feeling that if you get off the ride, you’re never going to be able to get back on. So I sat with the idea of going freelance for a long time. It had nothing to do with the place that I worked or the people that I worked with—if anything, that’s what kept me in that kind of role for as long as it did. I was just ready for something different and I also wanted to prioritize my mental health in a way that wasn’t just a soundbite. So, after much soul-searching, and checking my bank account, I left TZR in October of 2022.
I launched my bi-monthly newsletter Anxiety Beer two years ago. The name came out of a joke from peak COVID when you couldn’t go to a bar, obviously, and we were all drinking probably more than we should have. And I’m a beer girl. I worked at a brewery in college and I would go up to the roof at 5 or 6 o’clock and say, ‘It’s anxiety beer time.’ I wanted to do some writing that wasn’t about beauty, and it was around the time that I started seeing a therapist. I was newly committed to prioritizing my mental health, and I wanted to be really open about it. The response has been amazing. I’ve had people reach out to me and say, ‘I didn’t realize other people felt this way.’ I have a sister publication called Beer Face, where I talk more about beauty, fashion, and style, but the crux of the newsletter is just wanting to have an open dialogue about mental health.
SKINCARE
Injectables
I’m a huge proponent of transparency in beauty. I go to Dr. Dendy Engelman at Shafer Clinic for Botox. As I was coming up in the beauty industry, I received treatments from other providers just because the opportunity presented itself and I loved seeing people’s technique, but I trust Dr. Engelman’s technique implicitly. When I sit in her chair, she’s like, ‘The usual stuff?’ I want to be able to move my eyebrows, but otherwise, I like being fairly frozen. I get it between my brows and the glabellar lines, and I just started getting it around my crow’s feet.
I also get Botox in my masseter muscles because I grind my teeth. When I was a baby editor, I went to a breakfast with Dr. Barbara Sturm—who’s so sweet and lovely, but also very direct—and she was like, ‘Darling, your jaw’s insane. Your muscles are really overdeveloped.’ I took it hard, but then I saw photos of myself where, yeah, my jaw had started to get really large. It might’ve been Dr. Amy Wechsler who first started injecting my masseters, but they started to go down after that. It completely changed my face. Actually, my dentist loves that I get it because he’s like, ‘If you keep grinding your teeth, you’re going to have to get them all pulled.’

I started getting filler when I was 31. Everyone’s cheeks start to flatten out with age, and I got to the point where I was looking at my face and knew something was changing, but I couldn’t figure out what. I get filler at the top of my cheekbones, maybe a little bit closer to my temples, now. Dr. Engelman also puts a little bit of filler right at the edge of my jawline, and we just started doing a tiny, tiny bit in my smile lines—everyone’s face ages differently, and I just know that’s going to be where I’ll see the most change over the next few years. I also get lip filler because my lips are a little bit uneven from side to side.
I see Dr. Macrene Alexiades about once a year to blast off my cherry angiomas. I also go to her for Pico Genesis to treat my melasma. I’ve definitely done stuff that hasn’t worked out for me. Dr. Dara Liotta gave me a lip flip, but my teeth are already small and I thought I looked crazy when I smiled. She did a really good job—I just didn’t like the look of it. And you can’t get rid of it—you have to wait for it to wear off. Beauty editors sometimes have to take one for the team. [Laughs]
Facials
Facials are one of my favorite things, and I’ve been so fortunate to see so many incredibly talented people. I first met Crystal Green maybe a year and a half ago. She has magic hands. She also has the most calming demeanor of anyone I’ve ever met. I’ve been seeing Elizabeth Grace Hand, the founder of Ställe Studios, recently. She’s like a walking billboard for herself because her skin is incredibly glowy. She also does buccal massage, and she’s really, really knowledgeable. Sofie Pavitt is another one. I met her years ago before she had her new studio or her own line, and she is the acne whisperer. She does the best extractions. She’s always the one that convinces me to do a peel, even though I hate peels—I don’t like the feeling and I think that we’re all over-exfoliating in general.
Cleansers
Cleansing has low-key become my favorite step. I love the ritual of it, and I get in there and do a knuckle massage—I think Aida Bicaj, another good facialist, was the one who taught me how to do it. I love the Epi.Logic True Calm Rosehip Gel Cleanser. The packaging is flawless and it foams up in the most beautiful way. I rarely get to the bottom of a product, and I’ve gone through two bottles. The texture of the U Beauty Mantle Skin Conditioning Wash is also absolutely fabulous. I use it when my skin’s particularly dry but still has some congestion.

I’ll double cleanse if I’m wearing a lot of makeup. The Peach & Lily Ginger Melt Oil Cleanser is divine. It has the perfect amount of slip and grip, so you’re actually getting makeup off. Sometimes oil cleansers leave a film behind, but once you rinse this one off, it’s actually gone. The Eadem Dew Dream Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm is my absolute favorite. My skin actually feels more hydrated after I use it, which is rare for a cleanser. Bioderma Sensibio H2O is the OG makeup remover though. My eyes are really, really sensitive, so I can’t use anything if it has any sort of fragrance, and this one really works for me. The Shiseido Facial Cotton is also low-key the best cotton in the game. It’s silky, silky soft. It’s really worth the investment.
The Tatcha Rice Wash Soft Cream Cleanser is my favorite type of exfoliator. Like I said, I don’t really enjoy exfoliating, but this one has just the perfect amount of grittiness. It really feels like it’s getting rid of dead skin, but it’s not stripping. The Current State Salicylic Acid + Green Tea Exfoliating Cleanser is nice if I’m getting a breakout. I like the combination of salicylic acid and green tea to calm everything down.
Toners + Essences
After I cleanse, I always use a moisturizing toner—your skin needs to be a little bit wet when you’re using a humectant afterwards, so that's how I set the stage. I like to switch them up. I got to go to Korea with Laneige when they were launching their Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer, and the clinicals are insane. It’s like a liquid moisturizer. I’m absolutely obsessed with it. I like Environ’s Botanical Infused Moisturizing Toner at night. Environ’s a brand I really, really love. You’ll spot it at every single dermatologist’s office.
If I am going to exfoliate, I will use an exfoliating toner. The Biologique Recherche Lotion P50 is the classic. I get a lot of bumpiness on my forehead, so once that starts to pop up, once or twice a week, I’ll grab the P50. I feel like I beat my face into submission at this point so the stinging doesn’t really bother me. The Danucera D22 Tonic is a gentler version of P50. It’s lovely. Getting a facial with Danuta Mieloch, who’s the founder of Danucera and Rescue Spa, is a religious experience. She somehow gets you so snatched. And then I keep the Tata Harper Floral Essence in my living room so my boyfriend and I can spritz each other. He’s becoming a full-fledged beauty boy.

Actives
I always use an antioxidant serum to protect my skin from free-radical damage because we live in New York City and it’s a gross, disgusting mess out there. I love Protocol’s Vitamin C Superserum. The issue with vitamin C is that it’s so unstable and the shelf life is short, so you have to use that shit or it will turn. Protocol formulates in a facility that’s free of oxygen and light and also used by NASA, which is so cool. I’ve gone through five bottles of the Superserum. It’s one of the best on the market. The SkinBetter+ Alto Defense Serum is pricey, but it makes a huge difference in fighting dark spots. I’ll use anything from SkinBetter+ honestly. They have clinicals for days. Recently, I’ve been using the Matter of Fact Brightening + Firming Serum. I’m wary sometimes when a product has such a high percentage of vitamin C—this one has 20 percent—but it works and it comes in a bottle that protects it from light and oxygen. And Caudalie’s Vinoperfect Radiance Dark Spot Serum is an alternative to vitamin C. I think it’s a sleeper hit from the brand. It’s so brightening. It’s usually what I use when my skin’s a bit irritated and I need to pare everything back.
I’ve been using prescription tretinoin since I was 25. I use it five nights a week. Lately, I’ve been using a custom mix from Agency that has tretinoin, niacinamide, and azelaic acid. Meanwhile, growth factors are all the rage right now. Anytime I’m not using a retinol at night, I’ll use the SkinMedica TNS+ Advanced Serum or the Epi.logic Master Plan. They’re pricey, but I do feel like they’re whipping your skin into shape. I think if you’re really concerned about signs of premature aging, investing in one of these as opposed to getting a million other things is a good idea. You’re going to get a lot of bang for your buck.
At this point in my life, I’m pretty lucky and don’t get a lot of breakouts, but when I do, they come out with a vengeance. I love the Starface Acne Patches—it’s genius to rebrand acne as something that’s fun and cute. Otherwise, I like INNBeauty Project’s Medicated Acne Serum. It’s salicylic acid-based, and it helps my pimples go away quickly. Good old benzoyl peroxide from the drugstore does the trick, too. Honestly, I’m more concerned about the hyperpigmentation after than the breakout itself. Mandelic acid is the AHA that everyone needs to know about. It’s great for all skin tones and it’s really gentle. I used Sofie Pavitt’s Mandelic Clearing Serum for two weeks after I had a really gnarly breakout on my cheek, and it got rid of the crazy mark it left.

Hydration
I always apply some sort of hydrating serum. The PCA Skin Hyaluronic Acid Boosting Serum and Alastin HA Immerse Serum are basically interchangeable—they both prompt your body to produce more hyaluronic acid. I know that hyaluronic acid is everywhere right now and you can get a more affordable version, but I like a really science-backed brand for this step.
The Dr. Loretta Intense Replenishing Ceramide Serum is one of those ‘if you know, you know’ serums. It feels like cashmere on your skin. It’s actually an occlusive serum, and it’s my last step before I go in with a moisturizer. The Of Other Worlds Light Beams Barrier Treatment is chock-full of glycerin. When my skin is freaking out with inflammation and I don’t know why, I pare back everything and just use this, and it makes my skin so happy. The Dieux Deliverance Trinity Serum is also so good for calming. I travel with it because it hydrates, it protects, and it calms everything down. And the Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Multi-Recovery Complex is my old-lady serum, but I’ve gone through six bottles of it. I love using it at night and slathering on some moisturizer afterward.
I believe that if you want to save money on your routine, you don’t have to invest in an expensive moisturizer. Like every other beauty girly, I am guilty of going to City Pharma in Paris, and they have Eucerin’s UreaRepair, which is the best moisturizer. It’s simple, it doesn’t pill, it leaves you with a nice glow, it’s light enough for the summer, and it’s thick enough for the winter. I came back to the US with eight bottles of it in my suitcase. In the summer, sometimes I switch over to Tata Harper’s Superkind Fortifying Moisturizer. It’s really lightweight, fragrance-free, and makes you glow like a disco ball. If I want a really fancy night cream, I like Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Super Anti-Aging Night Cream.

I know that everyone’s obsessed with slugging, and oh my God, the Futurewise Slug Balm is really good. I put it on religiously every night. Everyone should be locking their moisturizer in with an occlusive if you want to prevent moisture loss. And I’m not really an oil girl, but I remember learning about the Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil years ago—well before Chrissy Teigen posted about it—and it’s perfect.
Homeoplasmine is another French pharmacy staple. I keep one in my bag because my nose gets dry for reasons I still can’t understand. It’s great for the lips, too. And Dr. Dan’s Cortibalm Lip Balm is the least sexy product I own, but I will ride for it until the day I die. It has a very small percentage of hydrocortisone—and it’s only $5.
Masks
I definitely think we should be masking at home. Biologique Recherche’s Masque Vivant is a cult favorite for a reason. It really deep cleans your skin, but it sort of smells like garbage juice. [Laughs] Orveda’s Deep Clearing Mud Mask will suck everything out of your pores, too. That shit is crazy. And Renée Rouleau Triple Berry Smoothing Peel is another good one. Renée, the founder, is such a wealth of knowledge. We’re also birthday twins.
SPF
You might as well throw away any anti-aging stuff you’re using if you’re not using SPF. I like mineral sunscreens because there are some studies that suggest they can help prevent melasma. The EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 is sort of the industry standard. It rubs in well, and it doesn’t sting your eyes. Summer Fridays really nailed the formula of their ShadeDrops SPF 30 Mineral Milk Sunscreen. I did not think I was going to like it for reasons I don’t really understand, but again, it blends in seamlessly. The same goes for Colorescience’s SPF 50 Total Protection No-Show Mineral Sunscreen—I thought it was going to be very heavy and chalky. You have to work it out a little bit more, but it has a beautiful texture—it’s very velvety. If I do use a chemical sunscreen—probably if I’m wearing more makeup that day—I like Charlotte Tilbury Invisible UV Flawless Primer SPF 50. It sits really well, and it’s a nice primer for makeup so you don’t have to add an additional step. Then I actually keep Vacation’s Chardonnay Oil SPF 30 on my dresser—I put it on my hands before I go outside.
Tech
I love a good tool, even though your hands are ultimately the best. I get very puffy if I so much as look at a piece of sushi, and I love using Joanna Czech’s Facial Massager. It refuses to break. The NuFace is something that you have to use all of the time—you can’t just one and done it—but it’s good and really does lift everything. I was so skeptical about the Droplette when it first came out, but when my skin was really dry last year, I was using some of their Collagen Hydrofiller Capsules and my skin felt like a bouncy marshmallow afterward. When I have it out on the sink, it sort of looks like a vibrator—that’s actually a common problem in the beauty world. Is it a vibrator or a facial tool? Who knows? [Laughs] That’s the fun part.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:07,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/bronzer-101/,977,"If you’ve ever been confused about bronzers—what they’re supposed to do, how you’re supposed to choose one, and where the heck you’re supposed to apply them—well, of course you have. Bronzers are weirdly confusing. And it doesn’t help that in the past decade or so that they’ve risen in popularity alongside contouring products, which are vaguely similar to bronzers, but also very different! Then there’s the matter of finding the right shade, and also the right formula… Well today, makeup artist Harold James is here to help. The Paris-based bronzer wizard walked ITG through the ins and outs of adding warmth to any complexion.
First, figure out what you want overall
People get tripped up over bronzers for a lot of reasons, but confusion over whether or not you’re supposed to contour with a bronzer is probably number one. So let’s set this for the record once and for all: bronzers are purely meant to add warmth to your skin, and they are not contouring products! The big difference is that contouring formulas, with their cooler tones, are meant to obscure parts of the face. As a result, they sculpt definition. “Contour mimics the shadows of your face,” explains Harold. “You can't use a bronzer to create shadow because most bronzers have too much warmth.” Bronzers enhance the parts of your face where light hits almost in the same way a highlighter does, but instead of adding luminosity, it adds a layer of rich, sun-kissed heat.
Then, pick up the right shade
Harold says that “finding your shade is very personal” because you first have to decide how “warm” you’d like to look. Going for a subtle sun-kissed glow? A bronzer one to two shades darker than your foundation is good for an everyday level of warmth. If you’re angling to fake a day at the beach, try two to three shades darker. But you’re going to have to experiment no matter what, because this really isn’t a hard and fast rule. And please, please try to ignore viral bronzer tutorials that come across your screen. “Social media is a different world because you need a much darker bronzer to translate through the camera,” explains Harold. “When it's too dark in real life, it can look very harsh.”
And…the right formula
You’ll want to avoid traditional cream formulas if you’re a bronzer newbie, since those tend to be more pigmented and allow less room for user error. Instead, go for liquid or gel-creams because they are “easy to blend,” says Harold. It’s OK to stick with a powder bronzer if you’re super oily…but the most important thing to consider for either of these formulas is to start small and build up as needed. Harold says “When you do that, it’s nearly impossible to mess up.”
Apply bronzer using this technique…
OK, so you have your bronzer in-hand. Now, it’s time to apply it. Harold says he prefers to paint pigment on with his fingers. “When you warm up the texture in your hands, it's even easier to blend it out.” Like Harold said before, start with a very small amount, and then see how that blends into your overall look. After that first pass, Harold likes to deepen the coverage with a Beautyblender. “If you want even more control and coverage, you can use a dense brush instead.” Make sure you don’t go overboard. “There's such a misconception that you should apply a lot of bronzer, but that looks awful,” says Harold. “In the beginning it's really satisfying, but in the end it will dry down patchy.”
…And this roadmap
Where the sun hits your face is your ultimate bronzer roadmap. Start with the forehead—Harold likes to dot the hairline with pigment. Then he moves down the face, where he dots pigment right on top of the cheekbones. Overall, you want bronzer to be “very blended and hidden,” explains Harold. “Sometimes I like to add bronzer on top of the nose for extra warmth, and also down on the chest. That especially gives this sensual and seamless look.”
But wait! Let’s talk about makeup order of operations for a moment
Harold says it best: “If you want the bronzer to be soft, you apply it before foundation. We call that underpainting. Let it dry, and then you apply the foundation. The result is a very diffused, sun-kissed look. If you want more control and want it to be more precise, do it after the foundation, but before the blush. It gives more dimension to the face. This is very good when you have to take pictures.”
Now try it the Parisian way
“In France they love terracotta—that’s what they call bronzers,” says Harold. “You have to have it, otherwise you look sad.” Women will wear nothing but bronzer and lipstick, but, he adds, “this is very serious.” When it comes to Parisians and bronzers, “it can't be too orange.”
Or not! Up to you
The best thing about bronzers is their versatility. There are only so many places you can wear blush, for example. But bronzers? Sky’s the limit. “The ultimate goal is to bring warmth,” Harold reiterates. That could really be anywhere on your face. Even as a base on your lids. “It brings such beautiful depth there.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:11,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/chloe-fineman-saturday-night-live-beauty-routine/,2299,"“I grew up in Berkeley, California and had an eclectic, Bohemian childhood. Growing up, I wanted to be an actress and a dancer. I wanted to be Meryl Streep, basically, so I ended up going to the Tisch School at NYU. Comedy wasn’t in my mind at all. After graduating, I moved to Los Angeles to be an actor and kind of failed at it. When I found the Groundlings, an improv group, I didn’t know a lot of people; I was doing improv purely to make friends. In class, I got the suggestion to do Drew Barrymore, and afterwards, everyone was like, ‘Whoa.’ Around that time, Instagram was starting up, and people were starting to put stuff out, and that was that. I made a video compilation to audition for Saturday Night Live and the team liked mine. Then I did a showcase in LA. Ben Affleck was there—not to brag—and it went well. Then I flew out to New York and tested. The first time I tested, it was me, Bowen Yang, Ego Nwodim, Lauren Holt, and people who wanted to be writers. I auditioned twice and got it.
BEAUTY
I’ve always been into beauty in a crazy way. Cindy Crawford used to have these workout videos, and I was obsessed with them. I used to draw a beauty mark on my face. In high school—this is so toxic—I remember using a brown Sharpie. And then I’d cover my face with lipstick. I mean, people wore lip gloss at school already, but I was like, ""No, we’re doing lipstick. Huzzah!’ Then I remember when people started plucking their eyebrows, I was like, ‘Ugh, too much work.’ I went into my mom’s bathroom—or maybe I used my dad’s razor—and I shaved my brows right down the middle. I looked like a clown for a while.
SNL and beauty really go hand in hand in a big way. If your script gets picked, you get to decide the wigs and the costumes and the makeup. I will say, it can be a bit of a nightmare for me—I literally cut my hair recently because I had a short wig on during a Weekend Update. Plus, the art of what looks funny versus pretty is always a fine line to walk. I’m always referencing Absolutely Fabulous, which is a British show from the ‘90s. It’s incredible and my favorite thing ever. It features these two women that I always look to for wig inspo. For a recent skit, which got cut, I was trying to have a frazzled wig, but the wig looked too hot. [Laughs] By the way, I still keep my wigs in my oven. If I’m making my sweet potatoes, I take them out.

TREATMENTS
I'm in my thirties, which means I’m at peak med spa mistake age. It all turned dark during COVID. When they lifted enough restrictions in LA, I was like ‘This is the time to get Botox, because no one will see me for probably six months.’ But then I couldn’t lift my forehead until right when we came back to work—and for comedy and acting, you want to be able to move your face. Also, being around other women my age at work, and in New York in general, everyone’s like, ‘Oh, you should do this’ or ‘You’ve got to go here.’ I wanted to get a laser treatment before the first Met Gala I went to, and then next thing I knew I accidentally did Fraxel and couldn’t leave the house for seven days. Another time I wanted a subtle change in my lips, but then they became swollen and way out there. Every six months, I feel like I tell [my makeup artist] Marc Reagan, ‘Sorry, I made a mistake. Whoops.’ That said, Linda Behla is my favorite ever at Hayes Valley Medical Esthetics. She’s heaven. I’ve been going to her for years. I got Emsculpt last summer at Hayes, and it’s crazy what it did to my abs. Dr. Lara Devgan is my favorite for subtle treatments. I once got the tiniest amount of filler in my lips, and I didn’t bruise. They weren’t swollen either. I told her, ‘You’re a wizard.’
SKINCARE
Tracie Martyn’s Amla cleanser is generally great, and Tata Harper’s oil cleanser is great for removing makeup. It’s probably the one I use the most. I don’t think people realize how much makeup we’re wearing on SNL—it’s like a newscaster’s amount of makeup. Honestly, smell is number one for me. I like anything that reminds me of Berkeley—clean and hippie and natural. If that’s a part of anything I’m putting on my face, I feel good. Living Libations’s Best Skin Ever Seabuckthorn has my favorite scent ever.
I’ve used Biologique Recherche P50 maybe three times. I’m afraid of it. Everyone’s like, ‘The purge! The purge!’ And I don’t want to purge. But Kate Berlant, the host of Poog, which is my favorite podcast ever for all things, said it’s important, so I do have it and I look at it. Tracie Martyn has a good toner too, but I’m just not that good about it. Joanna Vargas’s Vitamin C Skin Rescue isn’t scary, nor does it smell like pennies and ham. If everything is just light and actually smells good, I’ll put it on my face no matter what—but the stuff that supposedly changes your life stinks. Like, to put P50 and then ham oil on top of it is really tough. I even hate sunscreen because I hate the smell.

I love U Beauty—that’s a big one for me. The founder, Tina Chen Craig, is iconic. I met her on a fashion trip and she told us she had a skincare line. We tried it and then were all like, ‘This is the best thing ever.’ Her stuff is so simple that I go to it frequently. I love the Resurfacing Compound, I throw on the Super Hydrator, and I love the Intensive Face Oil that she just came out with. To me, that’s easy. Done. And while I do think Augustinus Bader’s Rich Cream is worth the money, I will say that the moisturizer I return to when my skin is dry is Kat Burki’s Vitamin C Intensive Face Cream. I’ve been using it for years and years. It’s delicious. I have one at work. I have one at home. I like to keep it in the refrigerator, and it feels so good when I put it on.
MAKEUP
I don’t want to walk around with makeup on me, so I have it all in my dressing room. I love to slap on some Jones Road Miracle Balm—I have all of the shades—and Tata Harper Cream Blush in Peachy. U Beauty and Macrene both have tinted moisturizers that I love; I use shade 02 and Light-Medium respectively. U Beauty’s is unbelievable. It gives you a beautiful glow. It’s sort of like the Westman Atelier Complexion Drops, which are great but too oily for me.
When it comes to brows, I get mine tinted. In New York, I go to Azi Sacks—she’s a character. I love texting her, and being like, ‘Hey, when can I come in?’ She’s like, ‘April 2026.’ Anytime I see her, it’s probably because she had a cancellation. In LA, I used to go to Striiike, but now, I just go to Michelle Holmes for the same feathered brow look. She’s so lovely and talented and has a great brow serum called Rye. I use it all the time. She was the one who got me hooked on the Obagi brow serum, which has made my brows amazing and changed my life. It’s magic. Still, I like to fill them in with an Anastasia Beverly Hills pencil—I like all of them but especially Brow Wiz—in Taupe. I curl my lashes with the Kevyn Aucoin eyelash curler, and then I love all of Kevyn Aucoin’s mascaras. Tom Ford and Makeup by Mario have amazing neutral eyeshadow palettes. I love taupe-y shades. Meanwhile, Pat McGrath’s Mothership VII Divine Rose eyeshadow palette is great for going out.

The best lip liners ever are from Fara Homidi. They’re like nine million dollars, but I have never found better colors than Minky and Doux. I love all of the Bisou Balms from Violette_FR, too but especially Amour Fou and Bêtise. Les Filles En Rouje has these great gold lip palettes. They make my lips look like I got them filled. I always toss the Signature one in my purse.
I just got the Chanel Multi-Use Glow Stick. It’s really glistening and beautiful. Chanel also has my favorite waterproof eyeliner. I’ve been using 30 Marine, the navy blue one, since high school. Brown is also great—I feel like black eyeliner looks really harsh on me since I have blue eyes. In the fall, I like Lancôme’s Black Coffee eyeliner, especially in my waterline.
HAIR
Jacob Schwartz at Mèche Salon has been dyeing my hair for nine years. I’ve been blonde probably for seven years now. He does Margot Robbie, Sydney Sweeney, and any famous blonde really. He’s the best. There’s something weird with comedy and blonde. For me, dark hair is drama, so when I did Francis Ford Coppola’s movie Megalopolis, I had to be a brunette. Then I went back to SNL and everyone was confused. They were like, ‘You have to be blonde.’ This is dorky, but over the summer I went to Comédie-Française, an old theater in Paris, and on the walls, one side was full of dramatic actors and the other side was comedic actors. All of the comedians were blonde or strawberry blonde, and all of the dramatic actors were brunette. I’ve at least figured out the color, but when it comes to the cut, I’m like, ‘I don’t know,’ so I just get it short. My friend Desiree Roberts, who was the first person to make me blonde, cuts it. She cuts every one of my family and friends’ hair, too. She even did my sister’s hair at her wedding. If I’m in New York and can’t see Desiree or Jacob, I like Jenna Perry.
For products, I love RŌZ, Mara Roszak’s line. She does Emma Stone, and anything that’s on her hair is great. It all smells like heaven. I use the Foundation shampoo and conditioner, but I love the Santa Lucia styling oil and the milk hair serum, too. LolaVie, Jennifer Aniston’s brand, smells so good, too, kind of like lemongrass and Malibu. And Kevin Murphy’s Doo Over is a really good hairspray. We use that at work.
FRAGRANCE
I’ve never liked feminine scents. I want my perfumes to be more gender-neutral. My girliest perfume is Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s Baccarat Rouge 540. It’s really good, but now everyone wears it. Terre d’Hermes is my tried-and-true. It smells orange-y and beautiful. I wore it all through college. My best friend, Casey Thomas Brown wears it. My boyfriend wears it. My dad wore it growing up, so I guess that makes me a disgusting pervert. [Laughs] I guess all the men in my life wear it.

Tom Broecker, who does the costumes at SNL, wears Straight to Heaven from Kilian. I would always ask what he was wearing, and he’d be like, ‘I’m not telling.’ Finally, he told me, and I bought it. The same thing happened with a friend of mine who wore Escentric Molecule 01 and wouldn’t tell me the name either. Then one day I was in an Uber Pool and I smelled it on someone who kindly told me what it was. And I wear Aēsop herbal deodorant, so that kind of acts like a scent, too.
At home, I burn Cire Trudon’s Abd El Kader candle. I love it, but Hotel Costes in Paris has my favorite candle. It’s their brown scented candle. I have the room spray version, too.
FITNESS + NAILS
My parents got really into pilates in the ’90s, so I had a full sex dungeon in my basement as a kid. I was in middle school when they got all the equipment, and that’s when you have middle school parties and boys over, so all my memories are us destroying those machines and laughing. Then I learned pilates myself when I was 14, so I have 21 years of pilates under my belt. Not to brag. I am a broken person, and I need pilates to relax. If I’m visiting my parents in Northern California, I go to X˙CORE. If I’m in LA, I go to Studio Metamorphosis. If I’m in New York, I like SLT or Tracy Anderson.
I hate getting manicures and pedicures—sitting there hurts my back. It’s better if I’m with my sister or my best friend because we just talk the whole time. For that I go to QQ Nails & Spa because they’re fast and I can always walk in. Otherwise, if I’m on my own, I’d much rather get a massage. I do a 90-minute body massage and a 30-minute foot massage at All Seasons Body Work in Greenwich Village. It’s the best.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:14,https://intothegloss.com/2024/01/arati-sharma-backbone-angels-ghlee-beauty-routine/,2395,"“I was born in Toronto and then we moved to a suburb called Brampton, which has a huge South Asian population. I always talk about that because it had a huge impact on my life. Growing up, I thought that I might want to do graphic design or something similar because I was artistic. I went to a regional arts high school, but after four years, I didn’t want to do it anymore. Honestly, I was always torn between the things that I wanted to do versus the things that I was supposed to do—but that pressure didn’t even come from my parents. At the time, I thought my parents were almost too freewheeling, where sometimes I was like, ‘Can you give me a little bit of direction?’ Now as a parent, I see how amazing that was, but what happened is that I put pressure on myself thinking about how hard it was for them to get here. I took a year off and then later went to university for a poli-sci degree. I loved ‘The West Wing,’ so I thought I’d be like C.J. Cregg, dream girl.
CAREER
After university and after a brief stint working at a nonprofit, I ended up at a small tech startup called Jet Cooper. It was a digital design studio that was helping other companies build their mobile apps and websites. This was around the time that tech was the thing, and I really felt like I needed to be a part of it. I was like, ‘I'm creative. I understand social media. And I kind of understand what's happening in technology.’ [Laughs] Actually, that’s how I met my husband; he was one of the founders. We were just a bunch of young kids then, but I helped him and his co-founder build the agency from the ground up and that’s how I got to hone my business skills. I figured out our operating model and ran the community aspect. Then Shopify acquired the company, and I went to Shopify. I think I was employee 290.
I got a chance to build a couple of different marketing arms for Shopify from the ground up—I left just three years ago. It was a great experience. I got to set up Kylie Jenner’s first store, I got to launch our first product conference. The company always created space for me to get my hands dirty. But after being there for almost eight years, it was time to do something else. I kept thinking, ‘What’s happening outside of e-commerce?’
That same year, I helped found Backbone Angels, a collective of angel investors. Angel investing is very common when you're a tech employee, especially when you've gone through an IPO. Usually, the early employees end up investing in other companies, but usually, the investors that you hear about are all the dudes. Even if you look at my husband, when Shopify went public, everyone was asking him to angel invest. The 10 of us at Backbone Angels are all women who were with the company since the early days, but whereas the men were asked to invest, we were just asked to be mentors or speak on a panel or support founders. I kept thinking, ‘Wait, this is not how wealth is generated.’ We came together with the idea that we wanted to invest in the founders that we wanted to see in the world, so our focus is on women and non-binary founders—and for me personally, my emphasis lies on women of color. Over time, I’ve become an accidental DTC investor. I have brands like Blume, Sheertex, SIDIA, and Bird&Be in my portfolio.

When my brother, Varun [Sharma], pitched me the idea for Ghlee, our ghee-based skincare line, I thought I had seen every type of skincare brand at that point. But he was like, ‘Why don’t we use ghee? Our elders have used it inside and out for ages. Why hasn’t anyone formulated with it?’ Six months after Varun pitched me, he came to me with a lip balm prototype. I have the worst chapped lips, but when I tried the product, it worked like nothing else I had ever used. At first, my mom and dad were making the ghee, and our sister came on to help with sales. It was a cute little family operation. We seeded the product to a lot of people, got amazing feedback, and then went through a lab and a chemist to launch.
When we first created Ghlee, our first couple iterations of our lip balms had the same texture as our lip mask. They were very creamy but very hard to keep stable in the applicators—but people were obsessed with them. When we did our user test, people would say, ‘I want it in a vat. I want it on my cuticles. I want it on my hands. I want it on my face.’ We did stabilize the lip balms because we, of course, didn’t want them to melt all over the place, but then we decided to build something for the OGs that wanted the product in a jar. We added squalane and kahai oil to it, and it became our mask.
Our lip scrub also has ghee in it, of course. Growing up, I used Vaseline and a toothbrush to exfoliate my lips, so when we started Ghlee, we wanted a really gentle lip scrub. I’m always annoyed when scrubs are too harsh. We went with cane brown sugar, which is a very big Indian thing. The cane exfoliates while the ghee moisturizes, so the scrub isn’t drying in any way.
SKINCARE
I had acne growing up, but honestly, my skin was great in my twenties so I was lazy with it. Then all of a sudden after I had my child, I had crazy rosacea flare-ups on my right cheek, and that’s when I had to really start taking care of my skin again. A friend of mine went through the same thing after she had her first child and Pai Skincare seemed to really help her. I’ve adopted some of their products into my own routine since.
Some hyaluronic acid serums are too thick on my skin, but I really like Pai’s Lotus & Hyaluronic Acid Barrier Defence Mist. It’s really great when my rosacea is acting up. Common Heir’s Vitamin C Serum comes in single-dose capsules, which I love because so many vitamin C serums come in clear bottles with droppers, so the product oxidizes every time you open it up. Ranavat’s Brightening Saffron Serum has similar properties to vitamin C. It really helps with hyperpigmentation. When I stopped using it for two months, my skin definitely looked more dull. It’s South Asian-founded, too. The serum has a high price point, and saffron is obviously a very expensive ingredient, but you also never see our things as luxe. I love that the founder, Michelle Ranavat, is elevating our POV.

To cleanse, I love Biologique Recherche’s Lait E.V., but I feel like it leaves behind a film on my skin. Sahajan’s Golden Milk Cleanser has the milky texture of the Lait E.V. without the film. Meanwhile, Caudalíe’s Beauty Elixir has been a consistent empty in my routine for 10 years. I always have an extra—if I stop using it, I break out.
Tower 28 is such a great brand overall—I discovered it through the SOS Rescue Spray. Then I tried the SOS Rescue Serum, and I remember thinking it was the serum I’ve waited for all of my life. It’s light. It’s clear. It really does have an impact on redness. It’s so hard to believe marketing when you’re in this industry yourself, but Tower 28 is dead on. My pores even look tighter after I use it.
Water-based moisturizers—like Tatcha’s Water Cream and Peter Thomas Roth’s Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream—are it for me. I love that they’re light because I like to layer an oil—like Blume Meltdown Acne Oil—on top, especially at nighttime. In the winter, I really like True Botanicals’ Renew Pure Radiance Oil. I discovered the brand when I had a facial in California that used just True Botanicals products. My skin was unbelievable afterwards. Their Neck, Décolleté & Boob Cream is also very good. I’ve also tried every sunscreen on the market, but I’ve consistently used Elta MD’s Tinted SPF 46. I always have one in my bag. It’s light. It works with my skin tone. It’s my go-to.
I’m a big fan of exfoliating. Every once in a while, I’ll use Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Universal Daily Peel Pads. If I want an exfoliating mask, I go for AAVRANI’s Glow Activating Exfoliator. It’s a clay mask that’s turmeric-infused. I run really hot, and I love that it feels cool on my skin. And I discovered Alumier’s Retinol Resurfacing Serum 1.0 through Joanna Auguste, the founder of The Face Lab. I wasn’t a big retinol gal before, but this one is really good. It has really helped with my crow’s feet.
I’m turning 38 this year. Overall, I’m not opposed to any surgeries, but they’re not for me right now. That said, I’ve tried Botox. I first got it on my massaters because I grind my teeth so hard. When I got it done, I actually realized how much tension I was holding in my jaw, and it kind of changed my life—I felt so relaxed. After that, I got Botox in my forehead because I have the most expressive face. And I love Forma, the radiofrequency treatment. It really tightens my skin.

MAKEUP
I’m very minimal when it comes to makeup because I have a slight silicone allergy. If I wear a lot of makeup, I’ll get pretty bad milia. I’ve tried non-silicone foundations, but those don’t blend as well. I usually end up using Vasanti’s Liquid VO2 all over my face.
When you’re a brown girl, you deal with hyperpigmentation. I have really dark, indented eye circles, and I feel like I’ve tried every concealer on the market. Kulfi Beauty’s Main Match Concealer is the only one that doesn’t end up creasing. I have a couple of shades that I rotate and mix depending on how tan I am, but I usually end up using Mango Drop and Glossy Guaba.
Patrick Ta’s Crème & Powder Blush Duo in She's That Girl was practically made for brown girls. It’s so good on my skin. I like the peachy glow a lot. I don’t typically wear cream blushes because they tend to melt on me, but this is perfect, especially with the combination of the powder.
I was very intimidated by highlighter for a long time, but I love how Ami Colé’s Light Catching Highlighter looks on my skin. It gives me a sort of golden glow that really works for me—I think maybe the issue with other highlighters is that the colors were too cool. I love their Lash-Amplifying Mascara, too. Oh, and the Lip Treatment Oil is so good. I’m learning how to line my lips correctly. [Laughs] Honestly, I go through phases with lipstick—I love a bright red like Gucci’s Velvet Matte Lipstick in Odalie Red. But right now, I like more of a gloss vibe. I’ve been using Merit’s Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil in Pink Beet, a cool pink.
HAIR
I’m Indian. We care about our hair. We’re always oiling it. Your mom’s oiling it. Your grandma’s doing it to her mom. I love Fable and Mane’s HoliRoots Hair Oil. I use it as a pre-wash, too. I’m a try-everything-gal, so I don’t have a go-to shampoo, but for conditioner, I’ve been using Bumble and bumble’s Bond-Building Repair Conditioner. Once a week, I’ll use Briogeo’s Charcoal + Coconut Oil Micro-Exfoliating Shampoo because my hair gets congested easily.
My hair is naturally very wavy, but I got into a bad habit of constantly straightening it because I didn’t know what to do with it. Now I’m trying to regain my curl pattern so I’ve been air drying my hair after I put Ceremonia’s Pequi Curl Activator on when it’s damp.

FRAGRANCE
I’m into really fresh scents—everything else gives me a headache. I was a Le Labo Santal 33 girl for a really long time, but then it felt too heavy for me. Right now, my scent is Diptyque’s Philosykos. Scent changes on my end, as it does for everybody, and I really love how Philosykos comes through. I love Glossier You, too. I usually use the Solid, but I just got the Rollerball and I always have it on me—it’s the one that always gets me the most compliments.
Kilian’s Roses On Ice is my going out perfume and D.S. & Durga’s Radio Bombay is nostalgic. It makes me feel like I’m in India. It’s so beautiful. I especially love using it during the winter. But I love D.S. & Durga candles even more than their perfumes. They’re all over my house. Concrete After Lightning, Big Sur After Rain, and Portable Fireplace are amazing.
I love what Erin Kleinberg is doing with her brand SIDIA for the body and hand care categories. I’m so concerned about my hands lately where I’m like, ‘Oh my God. Why are they drying up?’ I’m noticing fine lines around them, so I really like her Hand Serum. But SIDIA candles are amazing. Wired and Braless are named so correctly. I have Braless in my bedroom, and I kid you not, after a long day of meetings or if I’ve had a crazy mom day, I light it and take off my bra and I’m like, ‘No one talk to me. I’m going to watch Housewives.’ It’s like Pavlov’s dog.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:20,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/elizabeth-grace-hand-stalle-studios-jon-folkesson-skincare/,1896,"Elizabeth Grace Hand, the aesthetician and founder of New York facial studio Ställe Studios—a favorite of clients like influencer Alix Earle and gallerist Hannah Traore for its bespoke, treatment-focused approach—met her partner, Jon Folkesson, in 2019. It was Valentine’s Day and Hand had all but given up on dating. “I was 29, I had been dating in the city since I moved here for college at 19, and it was douchebag after douchebag after douchebag,” she says. “I was exhausted, but I liked my job and I liked my friends, so I thought, ‘I like cats. I’ll be a cat lady.’ I was really happy with that.” Then her roommate introduced her to Jon, and five years later, the couple lives together with their cat, Muesli Pettifleur. But this Valentine’s Day, we’re focusing on more than just their love story (though, of course, we made sure to ask about that, too.) In the half decade that he’s known Elizabeth, Jon’s skincare routine has gone from one face cream he haphazardly picked up at Aēsop, to two very serious morning and night routines, and a few injectables thrown into the mix. It all started at The Bowery Hotel, with a glass of sparkling water and a $1,200 charge from Dr. Barbara Sturm. Elizabeth and Jon explain below.
Jon Folkesson:
When I met Elizabeth, I was six months into living in New York—I had moved from Stockholm, where I lived my entire life. I had met her roommate, Frans, through other Swedes in the city. It was my first Valentine’s Day in the US, and I went over to their apartment. Elizabeth came in and sat on the couch. She was drinking a can of Recess.
Elizabeth Grace Hand:
I was working for Dr. Barbara Sturm as a sales rep at the time. I had just come back from a long day at work. I was having some friends over for hors d’oeuvres before they went to dinner across the street at Rosie’s in the East Village.
JF:
She was—is—a beautiful girl, so I started chatting her up.
EGH:
I could tell that he was into me, but I was so anti-dating at that point that I didn’t really see him. I mean, we talked and he was really sweet, but I was like, ‘Oh. It’s just another one of Frans’s weird friends.’
JF:
The next day, Frans sent me a selfie from her Instagram.
EGH:
Frans inviting Jon over wasn’t a setup, but we later learned that he realized we’d be a good match when we were at the apartment.
JF:
I asked Frans to give me her number and if she had said anything about me. He said, ‘Yeah. She said that you’re very Swedish.’
EGH:
So Jon texted me, ‘Hey, Elizabeth. This is Jon, Frans’s very Swedish friend.’
JF:
That’s one of the best texts I’ve ever sent. I asked her to get drinks at Altro Paradiso. Her response wasn’t super friendly, but she said yes.
EGH: 
I remember telling a girl at work, ‘Ugh. What a douchebag. He wants to go to a restaurant on the west side. He knows I live on the east side.’ That’s how fucked up I was in the head. I was in a major ‘I hate men’ phase.
JF:
The obvious reason was that I lived in the West Village and I had been to the East Village maybe once since I moved to New York. I didn’t know shit over there.
EGH:
I suggested The Bowery Hotel instead.
JF:
She had a glass of water on our date.
EGH:
It was sparkling. It was the first time I was dating in my era of deciding I was a cat lady. I was going to be fully me. I had no agenda. I didn’t go into it thinking he would be my partner.
JF:
But I enjoyed her company a lot. I left happy.

EGH: 
Of course, we talked about what we did for work. He told me his office was on Lexington and 52nd, so after a couple of days passed and he hadn’t texted me, I was like, ‘Fuck it. I’ll be the one to text him.’ I said, ‘I’m going to be nearby at Barneys doing a Sturm training. You should come. I can help you with your skincare routine.’ He didn’t have a routine, and also, I thought to myself, ‘Well, if I can at least get a sale out of him…’
JF:
At that point, I knew nothing about skincare. The only product I owned was a face cream from Aēsop. I didn’t even know cleansers existed. But I was really happy that she texted me because it was a sign that she wanted to see me. I showed up at Barneys, where I’d never been before, and I wanted to support her because she was working. I asked her what she thought I needed, and she started picking one thing after another.
I walked out with two different cleansers, two different serums, and I think, two different creams. I didn’t ask how much the products cost because I didn’t want to be that guy. I just handed her my credit card and didn’t look at the receipt until I left, but I got a fucking shock when I did. It was $1,200. I was like, ‘Maybe this is what people do here.’
EGH:
After that, I was like, ‘So what are you doing this weekend?’ [Laughs]

JF:
My routine looks very different now. First of all, I probably am the most spoiled partner in terms of skincare. I’ve been a guinea pig for her, and I do what she tells me to do.
EGH:
Maintenance and prevention is really the goal with him. It’s winter in New York and he’s doing infrared saunas and cold plunges. He does a lot of sweaty workouts, too. He can get a little dry, red, and clogged in the T-zone.
JF:
In the mornings, I need my routine to be quick. I hydrate with lemon water, do ten minutes of yoga, take a shower, and put on my products. I start off with the Retrouvé Conditioning Tonic, which is by far the best essence I’ve ever used.
EGH:
It’s also really good if he shaves too because it has chamomile. It’s so calming.
JF:
I recently started using Chanel’s La Solution 10 De Chanel. It doesn’t have a scent, and it lasts on your skin. Then I put on my sunscreen, Auteur’s Definitive Sun Drops SPF 50, which is not something that I would use unless I were with an aesthetician. Before I met Elizabeth, the only time I’d wear sunscreen was on vacation.
EGH:
At night, he starts off with the Retrouvé Luminous Cleansing Elixir.
JF:
It’s really good. I hate when it takes too long to get a cleanser off your face. I want to put water on my face twice at most. Having to splash water on your face ten times is so annoying. After my cleanser, I apply the BioEffect 30 Day Treatment.
EGH:
It’s a growth factor serum made from barley. It helps promote collagen production in the skin. The 30 Day Treatment comes with three dropper bottles that last most people between six to eight weeks. When one runs out, you go to the next one. They’re separated into three vials to keep the formula really stable.
JFG:
Then I use the Retrouvé Intensive Replenishing Facial Moisturizer. I love this one. I don’t want to oversell anything, but Retrouvé is a game-changer. I only use one pump, and it still works for my dry skin. I carry it down to my neck and chest. Then it’s time for my Retrouvé Eye Concentrate. It feels very thick and nourishing.
EGH:
Apply it with your ring finger for the perfect amount of pressure.

JF:
Face oils seemed too greasy to me, but the Retrouvé Balancing Face Oil is not at all sticky. It feels great. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is really soft and dewy.
EGH:
During the week, we sprinkle in different steps.
JF:
Like exfoliation, which kind of takes a higher level of education. [Laughs]
EGH:
I’ll have him use the Sachi Ursolic Acid & Retinal Overnight Reform one or two times a week at night. Otherwise, I have him use something with an enzyme, like the Auteur Definitive Enzyme Cleanser, or some sort of acid, like the Sachi Complexion Clarifying Accelerator. The Sachi Accelerator has mandelic acid, which is really good for people that are more fair. It also has Manuka honey, which is really nice. The Retrouvé Skin Brilliance Priming Pads are nice for the winter especially because they use lactic acid. They’re also very juicy so you have enough product to run them through your hands, too.
JF:
And I have two favorite masks, the Augustinus Bader Face Cream Mask and the Biologique Recherche Creme Masque Vernix—not the Masque Vivant; that one smells disgusting. I call the Vernix the banana mask because it smells like a ripe banana. It makes your skin so soft. If I’m in a hurry and I want to go to bed, I could just do a mask instead of my night routine. I have phases with them. Sometimes I use one every three days, but right now, I’m using one once a week.

When it comes to treatments, I’ve done Botox once at Plump with Amy Lee. Elizabeth was getting filler, and I sat in the room with her. During the treatment, Amy said, ‘You should get Botox.’ I feel like Elizabeth and Amy probably talked about it before I went in. [Laughs] Elizabeth had tried to convince me before and I said no because I didn’t want to have something that I needed to spend $1,000 on every couple of months, but I got a little bit of Botox around my angry elevens and around my eyes. After a week, I went back for a touch-up and got more. After it settled, my wrinkles were completely gone. It’s actually really cool, what Botox does to you. I would get it again. Why not?
Overall, I’m happy that I have a routine that makes me feel fresh and clean. I’ve always been into health, even though I had my phases where I partied. Now, I don’t drink, I exercise, I try to eat very clean. I see skincare as a part of the lifestyle of trying to care for myself. But for any men reading this: Your routine doesn’t have to be complicated—I just have the luxury of having Elizabeth and a lot of products at home. Everyone wants to feel like they are their best self. Skincare helps.

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:21,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/sheena-zadeh-kosas-beauty-routine/,2042,"“I did my undergrad in biology. Pretty much right after graduating college, I had a moment where it became clear to me that my truest desire was to have my own beauty brand. I knew that I had a strong point of view on color, formula, makeup, and the overall approach to beauty because I was everyone’s go-to beauty person growing up. I was the one that you would go to and ask, ‘I’m going somewhere. Can you do my makeup? What lipstick should I buy? How do I do this? What are the steps?’ I ended up going to business school not long after coming to this realization. I graduated during the Great Recession and had a really rough time. I couldn’t find any work, and I still had this love affair with color, so I decided to spend some time doing the one final thing that I hadn’t really gotten a chance to do, which was working with a fine artist in Los Angeles and getting an art education. Then I was at a crossroads and had to ask myself if I wanted to pursue fine art as a career or start this beauty brand that I’d had inside of me for so many years.
I didn’t go into Kosas with a big brand plan or marketing strategy. It started with lipstick. I was always reaching for that ‘your lips but better’ shade, but it was hard with my olive skin tone. I wanted shades that look truly human—not beige, but actual flesh tones. I also wanted to formulate products in a very specific way. I wanted to put those two things together and put it out in the world with so much love and intention. The name of the brand is actually based on the Vedic philosophy of koshas. The word kosha literally translates to sheath in Sanskrit, and according to the philosophy, there are five layers to the self and your essence—your true capital ‘S’ self, not the self that we put out in the world—emanates outward into your appearance. Essentially, beauty is a reflection of who you truly are. And that’s very much the story I want to tell with Kosas. I received a lot of messaging from the beauty industry about covering or fixing myself and that never resonated with me. I think that it’s very natural for us to want to express ourselves to reveal who we truly are. I do actually think we have done that.

SKINCARE
I approach skincare really carefully because I have incredibly acne-prone and highly reactive skin. Cleansing is the most important thing to me, especially with all the makeup I wear every day. I double cleanse at night. Bioderma Sensibio H2O is the best micellar water—it can cut through so many layers of makeup. I use it with cotton ovals that are kind of large. That’s really important because they give me a very gentle physical exfoliation. The Paula’s Choice Resist cleanser is very, very light but really thorough without being stripping. It also has ceramides, which are great for your skin barrier. Sometimes I’ll layer on an oil or a balm cleanser, like Living Libations’ Seabuckthorn Best Skin Ever, if I need to triple cleanse.
Angelia Caglia has given me facials before, and she has a really gentle approach to skin. I discovered her Cell Forté serum within the last six months, and it’s remarkable. My skin was more toned and smooth right after the first use. It’s a huge splurge, but it’s made with human stem cells—I use it to the very last drop. It was also love at first sight with Shani Darden’s plumping serum. I quit using traditional moisturizers maybe two or three years ago—I naturally have large pores and quite a bit of texture, and traditional heavier moisturizers were almost enlarging my pores. Once I stepped using them, I saw a lot of improvement. The plumping serum has enough hydration for me with the glycerin and snow mushroom. Honestly though, I’ll use it maybe once a week. And I use Joanna Czech’s C+ serum maybe twice a month because it can be really sensitizing for me. Twice is enough for my skin to get the brightening effect that I want. The serum that I do use regularly is our Kosas Plump + Juicy serum. I formulated it for my own skin type. If I ever see anyone with an active breakout, I’m like, ‘Quit everything, only double cleanse and use our serum spray.’ That’s my take—and it works. It has artemisia flower extract, which is highly soothing, peptides for healing, and probiotics to support your skin’s microbiome. And I only recently started using eye cream. I never thought the day would come; It’s almost like you don’t know you’re going to age until it happens. I’ve been using Relevant Beauty’s Beam + Glow eye serum. It’s not heavy or greasy like other eye creams I’ve tried, which gave me milia.

If I had to go to a deserted island, I would take the Kosas DreamBeam sunscreen with me. It has 21.7% zinc. I formulated it when I put my daughter in surf camp over the summer. They wouldn’t let her go in the water unless her face was completely covered in zinc; if you want to know what works, ask a surfer. They wouldn’t accept other kinds of sunscreen—and they were even specific about which zinc-based sunscreens the kids used because it had to have a specific concentration of zinc. Zinc is tough because it’s very white, so it almost reflects a blue purple on your skin. We added a peachy-pink hue to neutralize that to an extent, and it’s certainly minimized, but it’s not going to completely disappear. It’s a great base for makeup. Honestly, I never wore sunscreen before DreamBeam, even though it’s the one thing that you’re supposed to wear. It broke me out and it made my makeup look bad, so I just wouldn’t. DreamBeam really hits all of my criteria: It feels good, it works well under makeup, and it does not cause any breakouts.
And then I love my Nuface. Whenever I’m consistent with it—if I actually use it two or three days a week for even five or 10 minutes—it feels like my face is getting a workout. I have been wanting to get a Ziip because of the different face exercises on their app. I love the founder, Melanie Simon. Speaking of face workouts, I love FaceGym. I feel like I can never get a deep enough face massage, and this is the one place where they’re fully dedicated to it. There are so many muscles in our faces and we carry so much tension. There’s one close to my house, so I’ve started going once a month. The last time I went, I did a cryo treatment and loved it. I was so smooth and bright for weeks after.
MAKEUP
After sunscreen, I do one pump of BB Burst in Medium Warm 24 all over. Then I add on a second later—I very strongly believe in working in multiple thin layers. I use our concealer in 3.8 under my eyes. I’m always after plumpness and lift for my overall look, and concealer is definitely a part of shaping that antigravity. [Laughs] I use quite a bit of Cloud Set setting powder in Feathery and Comfy because it gives you this beautiful filter without flattening your face. Then I use a huge amount of Sun Show bronzer in Beachy because I can also sculpt and lift with it.

For my brows, I do either two or three steps. I use Brow Pop Nano in Dark Brown and feather the top of the tail of my brow because that also creates a bit of a lift. I leave the front of my brow completely naked to prevent boxiness. Then I use Air Brow gel in Medium Brown mostly on the tail end of my brow and Air Brow in Clear on the front part so it doesn’t look heavy.
I started wearing eyeshadow a year and a half ago, and it’s been life-changing for me. I believe very strongly in maximizing every feature, and for many years, I wasn’t doing that. I wasn’t allowing myself the time to concentrate on my eyes, and I was also afraid of looking too much, so eyeshadow scared me. But when I started using the Undressed palette, I felt like I was finally maximizing all of my real estate. That’s how I felt about my lips, too. Right now, my obsession is our Wet Sticks. They have a beautiful balm-y texture. I have several favorite shades, including 100 Degrees, and I grab one depending on how I feel. Then of course, I always have a LipFuel in Baseline around.
HAIR
I regularly get a cut and color from Tauni Dawson. That’s the basis for everything. I wash my hair every two to three days, and I only use Davines MOMO shampoo and Heart of Glass conditioner. I’m so minimal with hair products because my hair gets weighed down easily, and I also have acne-prone body skin, which most hair products exacerbate. I use a Dyson hair dryer to blow it out, and I do a soft wave with the T3 Curl X 1.5” curling iron.
NAILS
Brittany Boyce of Nails of LA has completely changed my relationship with my nails. She gives me a builder gel manicure in her signature almond shape. It’s so flattering and makes me feel so feminine. I instantly feel more put together when I have my nails done, so I’m religious about it. It’s bizarre because getting the manicure is not that short of a process—it’s like two hours every time. I tend to go towards more neutral shades, usually some variation of white, pink, or a beige that matches my skin tone. When I feel like having color, Brittany lets me mix my own shade. It’s so fun. I love a very specific red with just the right amount of fuschia or orange. Then one of my favorite tricks is to put a matte coat on top. Something about a matte reddish fuchsia nail is very powerful.

FRAGRANCE
I am obsessed with the scent of leather, sandalwood, vanilla, and tobacco. My dad had pipes growing up, and I have a very strong childhood memory of going into his room just for the smell. Also, if I close my eyes and smell sandalwood, I swear to God I go to another realm. I only started wearing fragrance again because I discovered Sunlit Blooms from DedCool. I’m obsessed with it. It has a sort of grounded sweetness, but it’s not sugary sweet. It smells like if you go under sheets and you see the sunlight coming through, like the feeling of being in love. I recently got Haunted Rose from Future Society. The premise of the company is really cool. They sequence the DNA of extinct flowers to create scents. That drew me in, but a story is never enough. It really has to smell good, too, and when I picked it up, it kind of hit at the heart. I normally can’t stand much in the way of florals, but it has a good balance.
I also really love the smell of amber, and Sacred + Divine has a 333 candle that’s beautiful. And I love the packaging of the Diptyque Baies candle. It’s an all-black vessel, and it gives me such joy. It’s very soft and never overwhelming. I keep it in my bedroom.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:23,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/tina-chen-craig-u-beauty-routine/,2351,"“I started Bag Snob, one of the world’s first luxury fashion blogs, in 2005. Then I launched Beauty Snob. My passion has always really been in beauty because it’s such a great equalizer. Anyone can buy lipstick to make themselves feel better. And naturally, just blogging about beauty and working as an editor at Vogue China for five years, I then organically became a consultant for some of the biggest beauty brands in the world, including Natura Bissé, Clé de Peau, La Prairie, Augustinus Bader, and Charlotte Tilbury.
I’ve since launched my brand, U Beauty. At the beginning, I really didn’t think that the world needed another skincare brand—and certainly not from an influencer. But the opportunity came about when I was at dinner with my friend Skip Borghese, who I’ve known for almost 20 years, and his wife, Katie, who is now my co-founder. I was frustrated because I was traveling with a huge brand and no longer believed in the beauty industry. I felt like technology had not changed. It was stagnant. But they told me about these Siren capsules that they had been working on with a medical-grade lab in Italy that hadn't been brought to life. They asked if I wanted to create my dream product with them. I said, ‘Well, I don’t believe what you’re telling me.’ A delivery system that’s intuitive and that would only benefit your skin where it needed it? It sounded like sci-fi.
Still, I ended up meeting with the Italians, as I call them, and gave them my ideas for a ‘laser in a bottle.’ At the time, I was in my mid-forties and I had the worst rosacea, so I couldn't use active ingredients. I was so scared to use retinol because, if you think about it, your face is not all the same. Some areas need the retinol and some areas don’t. But we’re blindly applying it all over, hoping that it gets to where it needs to go, possibly irritating and definitely damaging healthy skin cells. We came up with the Resurfacing Compound, our first product. I took the sample to Paris Fashion Week, used it on a Tuesday, and three days later, at the Dior show on Friday, everybody was saying my skin looked amazing. This was at the end of fashion month, when everyone’s tired, and there I was with glowing skin and no irritation. That’s when I realized the delivery system really worked.
Honestly, I used to hate serums. I thought they were such BS. But my friends, people like Joanna Czech, Eva Chen, and Michelle Lee, who are very knowledgeable about beauty, all tried it and loved it, too. Net-A-Porter ended up wanting to sell it because their head buyer tried it and her skin changed in three days. I thought to myself, ‘OK, we’ll sell this much in a year and we’re never going to make another product. It’s just enough for me to buy a bunch of Birkins and call it a day.’ That year's supply sold out in 21 days. That’s how U Beauty came to be, the short version of it anyway.

SKINCARE
I started treatments like Botox very late, and honestly, I still don’t get a lot of stuff done. In my twenties, I was busy working. I was trying to have a baby in my thirties, so I was not going to inject anything into my skin. By my forties, I decided to try. Now I get Botox from Dr. Daniel Belkin. He does microtox and PicoToning. He was the first person that I let use lasers on me—I do that twice a year now. I’ve tried microneedling, but I don’t do it anymore because I felt like it was causing more pigmentation because of the inflammation. And I’ve done EmFace at Advanced Skin Fitness in Dallas.
When I was in Seoul last summer, I got a three-step tightening treatment from Blackpink’s dermatologist. She’s this big secret—her name is Dr. Yoon. That’s all I can say because I’ve been sworn to secrecy. She’s all about improving the texture and health of the skin and avoiding surgery. She uses two electronic gloves that massage and tighten, and Korean acupuncture needles that are ten times thicker than Chinese acupuncture needles. She also invented a machine that’s a hybrid of two others—one of which is Ulthera. People usually get put under for it because it’s so painful but I stayed awake. It hurt like a mofo. I was so bruised after, too—but the tightening worked.
For facials I love Miranda Sturce, Joanna Czech, and Iván Pol, or The Beauty Sandwich as people know him. Iván is so knowledgeable. He has a machine that snatches you, and I love his SS01 Secret Sauce. Joanna is still my favorite though because no one slaps a face like her. She’s got the strongest hands in the world. Then, when it comes to tools, I love Jillian Dempsey’s gold bar and Nurse Jamie’s beauty roller, which is great for lymphatic drainage.
I used to have a triple cleanse routine and I always thought there had to be a better way. Our Mantle Skin Conditioning Wash is the answer. It’s a beautiful, rich balm that really cleans and easily rinses off. Rather than using solubilizers to pull dirt and oil off your face, stripping your skin of its own natural oils, ours works with your skin to remove debris without stripping. Still, on days that I wear a lot of waterproof makeup for events, I use Almay Eye Makeup Remover Pads. They’ve been my best friends since I was in college—they really wipe off everything.

My first step after cleansing is always the Resurfacing Compound. It has vitamin A, vitamin C, AHAs, PHAs, and antioxidants, so it replaces so many other serums while gently resurfacing without irritation. I follow it up with our Super Hydrator, which is like a 3D moisture shield that protects your skin. It’s got a nice, rich cream texture. It melts into the skin and continually hydrates it for up to 48 hours.
Do you know about leaky vessels? I learned about them when I was going through a divorce and crying every night. My eye cream stopped working and I asked my biochemists why. They were like, ‘You have leaky vessels,’ and explained that as your skin ages, your blood vessels age, too, so when you cry, the extra cellular fluid gets pushed out through the vascular walls that are now more permeable. I was like, ‘My husband left me and now I have leaky vessels? It went from bad to worse.’ That was about two-and-a-half years ago, and not long after that we launched our Return Eye Concentrate. I’m biased, but I think it is the best eye cream on the planet. Within two weeks of launching, it became one of the top eye creams at all our retailers. It has real diamond powder, and with our Siren capsules, it’s able to penetrate deeper into the skin and activate collagen synthesis.
For sunscreen, I use our Multimodal Defender Broad SPF 30. It not only protects the skin, but it also corrects past damage. There’s an ester in there that lightens and brightens pigmentation. I use it at night as a spot treatment, too. No one believes that I used to be a sun worshiper—a literal tanorexic—until I show them photos. I’ve spent the last 35 years trying to reverse the damage. For a good drugstore sunscreen, I love La Roche Posay.
MAKEUP
I’ve always been a glowy girl. Kevyn Aucoin used to say that five-year-olds glow in certain places—like, if you look at them, they always glow right above the lip—so I always start with our Super Tinted Hydrator in 02 or 03 depending on my mood, and Multimodal Defender SPF 30 as a makeup base because the zinc in it gives off such a great glow. I use Trish McEvoy’s Correct and Even Full-Face Perfector in shade 2 if I have an event, and then Shiseido’s Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Concealer in 202 for my everyday life.
For my eyes, I love Victoria Beckham’s waterline pencil. And I’m obsessed with her satin kajal liners—all of them. They’re so creamy, and they don’t pull out your lash extensions. But I also love Haus Labs’ Optic Intensity Eyeliner. Titanium Shimmer, the silver shade, brightens everything. All I do is buy eyeliners and lip liners; if you look in my makeup bag, I have 20 on me at all times.

Michelle Phan does such a great job with her brand, EmCosmetics—I don’t know why it’s not talked about more. I love the Divine Skies eyeshadow palette in Saturn’s Return. Huda Beauty’s creamy eyeshadow palettes are great, too. And for events, Westman Atelier’s Eye Pods are fabulous. I love Les Jours. I’m also obsessed with Natasha Denona. I like that her Glam Eyeshadow Palette tells you where to use each shade so anyone can use it.
I use the Grande Lash Serum to grow my lashes. I’ve tried all the best ones, and this is the only one that actually works for me. If I don’t have lash extensions because they all fell out, then I’ll use Charlotte Tilbury’s mascara. And I love the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Freeze Gel and Brow Definer in Taupe.
For blush, I use a cheek jelly from LB in Rose. You have to buy this at Don Quijote in Tokyo; it’s not available anywhere else. My sister-in-law lives in Tokyo, and she sends me six every year. When it comes to contour, I like the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Biscuit. I contour the bridge of my nose with it. If I don’t want to put on eyeshadow, I’ll use it on my eyelids, too. Gucci Westman gave me that tip. Meanwhile, I’ve been using the Physician’s Formula Butter Glow since high school. I also use Victoria Beckham Contour Stylus in Marble like a bronzer. I love the shade and how it looks on my skin.
My favorite lip liners are from Jones Road Beauty. I use Mauve all around to triple the size of my lips. Then I go in with Nudist, which is a little darker. Those are my most used. I love Charlotte Tilbury’s Lip Cheat in Supersize Me for events. Huda Beauty has a great lip contour, as well. It’s self-sharpening. I love Muted Pink. And of course, our Plasma Lip Compound is amazing. My go-to is Orchid. It’s great with the Jones Road Mauve—that’s my daily combo. Then I set my face with Morphe Luminous Setting Spray.

HAIR
My hair is very high maintenance. Ever since I bleached my mop, I spend more on my hair than anything—and I’m very careful with it. My colorist stylist Adriana Tesler is in LA and has done my hair for 20 years. She was trained by Tracey Cunningham.
I only wash my hair once or twice a week. My favorite shampoo in the world is the R+Co Bleu Ingenious Thickening Shampoo—and I live for their Bleu conditioner, too. I switch them off with the Color Wow Color Security Shampoo and conditioner to see to what that does. And I still love Olaplex. I don’t care what anyone says. Every other week, I use their No.3 Hair Perfector as a hair mask and follow it up with the Olaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo and the No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner. In between washes, I spray my hair with the In Common Magic Myst 4-in-1 Leave-In. Then I put in Velcro curlers—mine are from a beauty store in Seoul called Olive Young—and it’s like I got a fresh blowout. That’s my secret to keep it very minimal chemical damage. I don’t even brush my hair. Oway’s Silk’n Glow Serum is from Norway, but it’s hard to find in the US. Luckily, Adriana sells it at her salon. It’s anti-frizz but also gives you a nice shine. I put a bit on my hands and then comb through my hair with them. I love the R+Co Bleu Smooth Seal Blow-Dry Mist, too. And Nick Stenson’s Light Hold Hair Spray is great.
I have my T3 straightening iron from 2007. It’s literally 15 years old, and it’s black—they’re all white now. It’s still the best. My son and I fight over it. It heats up within three seconds, and I actually feel like it improves the health of my hair while I use it. It’s sold out everywhere now. I’m obsessed with the Dyson Airstrait, too—and their Airwrap is pretty dope. And I love all of the T3 blow dryers.
FRAGRANCE
I go through two bottles of Matiere Premiere French Flower a year. Saks started selling it recently, but you could only get it in the UK before. I still like buying it in the Harrods fragrance hall, where I discovered it a few years ago. I also love Nasomatto’s Narcotic V. Overall, I love white florals that are kind of sexy and not too sweet, and that’s exactly what it smells like.
When it comes to candles, Baies from Diptyque is a classic, but my favorite candle in the world is their limited edition London candle. They only release it every two years. I’ve been emailing the team, ‘Where is it? Did you come out with it again? I need it.’ It smells like walking through a garden on spring morning in London. Fresh and clean and beautiful.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:24,https://intothegloss.com/2024/04/beauty-tools-skincare-spatula-scissors/,615,"If I’m trying to be the woman I want to be, all of my beauty tools come out to play. I wear my Dr. Dennis Gross SpectraLite LipWare for three minutes daily. I zap my face with my ZIIP every other day. I contour my face with my Jillian Dempsey Gold Bar as I catch up on TikTok. But inevitably, I get tired, and I use them less and less until the next time inspiration strikes. Throughout it all though, there are two tools that never have to worry about a lack of interest: a pair of scissors and a long, thin skincare spatula. My absolute Top Shelf heroes.
The scissors are, well, scissors. They’re gray. They were just over $6 on Amazon and bought in a hurry when I moved to a new apartment. There’s nothing extraordinary about them. They just do their one job: cut. In my case, they cut beauty products in half in my desperate attempt to carve out every last drop. They’ve helped me get through many a Neutrogena benzoyl peroxide container (sexy!) and Tula SPF 30 (the barista at my favorite coffee shop compliments me every time I wear it, and I’m not about to give up that serotonin). As long as a product comes in a thin-enough plastic, it’s fair game: Toothpaste tubes. Creams. Cleansers. You name it, I’ve cut it in half. In some cases, I’ve been able to scrape enough product to last me an additional week.
The other half of the equation is a dual-ended, silicone spatula. When Soft Services launched its Carea cream, which is housed in aluminum, I started to carve out the last bits of the lotion with its pump—it was one of the few body lotions that actually made my persistently dry skin look alive, and I wasn’t about to leave even a morsel of it behind. I later turned it upside down and smacked the bottle as hard as I could, but even that left some product at the bottom.
My scissors were useless in this case, but Soft Services swooped in with a clutch solution: a dual-ended, bright orange spatula that’s just over 6 inches long (I found an Amazon dupe here). One side is pointy to get into pesky, tiny corners, and the other side is flat, best for scraping the sides and the bottom of my containers. I know I could just dip my fingers into small-enough products, but the thought of inviting whatever bacteria is hanging out under my nails is enough to put me off that idea. The last time I called my handy spatula in for duty was last Friday. I had a tiny, sample-sized tube of Biologique Recherche’s Masque Vivant, a pungent—think: dark chocolate mixed with cheese—face mask several facialists swore would help my angry chin. It was my final hail mary after a week of looking like a hormonal teenager, and my spatula was a key player. A few scoops later, the tube was as empty as possible, the evidence sitting on my skin. Hormonal breakouts may be temporary, but the spatula is forever.

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:25,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/victoria-beckham-beauty-top-shelf-full-routine/,2231,"“I started Victoria Beckham Beauty because I knew that there was an appetite for it—but I wanted to do it in the way that I wanted to, with a real focus on clean beauty. Product ingredients are key. In the past, I struggled with my skin for so many years. When I was younger, I was seeing dermatologists who put me on all sorts of antibiotics and different topical solutions, and I decided to take the power back and really focus on what I was putting in and on my body. That meant looking at what I was eating but also the formulas that I was putting on my face. Of course, I still wanted our products to work, and that was challenging for my product development team and our labs, but we did it. I think that’s what makes us best in class.
SKINCARE
My skin has definitely become drier. It was oilier when I was younger and I didn’t like that, but as you age, you realize it’s quite good if you’ve got oily skin. I was very fortunate that I didn’t scar from the acne, but maybe if I had dry skin, I would have. I kept all skin types in mind when developing my Daily Cleansing Protocol, a duo consisting of an oil cleanser and a lactic acid gel cleanser. When I struggled with my skin, I couldn’t find the perfect cleanser. They would either irritate my skin and cause more breakouts or they were overly drying. You can either use my cleansers together or individually. At night, I use the oil cleanser first because it really does get the dirt and makeup off your face—so many cleansers claim to take makeup off but actually don’t—without stripping the natural oils that you want to hang on to. Then I’ll use the gel cleanser after that. But if I’m traveling and my skin is feeling a little drier, maybe I’ll just use the oil cleanser. Since the gel cleaner has lactic acid, you can use it once or twice a day, depending on your skin type. I like to use it on its own in the morning.
I developed the cleansers with Melanie Grant, who is a facialist I met years ago in Australia. She has been my skin guru since then. She is remarkable. She only ever uses the best in class products and she would always send me products to try. She’s actually the person that introduced me to Augustinus Bader years ago, so she is the one responsible for me collaborating with the brand. Like me, she’s struggled to find the perfect cleanser, which is why we decided to work together on the duo. She really is skin obsessed, and it’s been such a joy working with her.

If I have time after cleansing, I might use my Celluma Pro, which I’m quite obsessed with at the moment. I’ve genuinely noticed a difference in my skin texture since I started using it. Then I use my Augustinus Bader Cell Rejuvenating Power Serum, making sure that I press it into my skin, neck, and chest area quite firmly, followed by my Augustinus Bader Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturizer—I feel like I have the perfect foundation for makeup with those two on. If I’m being completely honest, I do not use sunscreen every day. Well... I'll use it if I’m in Miami.
I recently worked with Iván Pol, better known as The Beauty Sandwich, when I was in LA. He gave me the most perfect facial treatment before walking the 'Lola' red carpet. In terms of facial treatments I can do at home, I’m a big fan of rollers and gua shas, especially in the mornings. The Skin Gym face roller and the Sisley Ginkgo Gua Sha are especially brilliant post flights and for depuffing. I also love the 111Skin Illuminating Rose Gold Eye Masks in the mornings, either as part of my skincare routine or whilst blowing out my hair—I want to use every minute wisely for extra skincare benefits.
MAKEUP
I always love a smoky, sexy eye. I will often start with my Smoky Eye Brick in Signature, combined with my Eyewear in Pecan—or sometimes Bottle Green—to contour the eye area. Then I use my Satin Kajal Liner just above the lash line and also a little bit underneath. If I’m going out at night, I go from using Cocoa to Cinnamon. Sometimes I’ll even use a bit of Sequin Green or Navy Noir if I want to have a little bit of a different take on my smoky eye. Quite often I use my Instant Brightening Waterline Pencil on the inside of my eye as well because sometimes using a darker color can be too much during the daytime. That said, I love a light touch. I do really love to wear makeup, but I have a less-is-more approach. When I contour, for example, I don’t like it to look like I’ve contoured. And I love lip liners, but I don’t want it to look too obvious that I’ve lined my lips. I’ve had the pleasure of working with [photographer] Peter Lindbergh quite a few times, and he’s all about a smoky eye, but it’s always smudgy and sexy—never harsh. It looks almost more like a natural shadow as opposed to a hard line.

I don’t really do a lot with my brows. I always say that Anastasia Soare, who is a very good friend of mine, is my eyebrow guru. Upon her recommendation I used Latisse for both my lashes and brows, and it helped to grow them back, but I haven’t used it in quite a while. These days, I’m obsessed with our Babyblade. I searched for the right brow product for a long time, something that came in a small enough component so that I could really get a precise application and carefully pencil individual hairs. I’ve never found a brow product quite like ours, which is why I decided to develop it myself. I use shade Medium Brown.
As far as lips go, I always line mine with my Lip Definer in shade No.2—I have about three of these in different bags at any one time—and then add my Posh Gloss on top. My go-to shades are Poolside and Picante.
HAIR
My hair is quite simple, really. I don’t do too much. Ken Paves, who is my best friend and hairdresser, is the only person that I let cut it. He is a genius. When it comes to hair, the more volume the better. But I do not like to feel too much texture in my hair, so Ken has a very light touch on products—he’ll use Wella’s Sugar Lift hairspray and L'Oreal Paris’ Elnett Satin Extra Strong Hold after a blowout. For my color, I go to Josh Wood, who is the master of hair color, in London. I was introduced to Milbon’s shampoo and Restorative Treatment by a friend, and I’m really liking the products. Harper has become quite obsessed with them, as well.
NAILS
I like my nails to be quite long. I either like a nude nail or a dark color—it depends on what I’m wearing to be honest. For ease, most of the time I wear a natural color because I create content quite often and I like my nails to not stand out too much. My philosophy is that a dark nail looks gorgeous if you’re wearing tailoring or if you’re going out for the night, but I also like to dress in quite a lot of color, and if I have a different color on my nails, I start to question what I’m wearing.
I’ve known [nail artist] Tom Bachik for years. I haven’t worked with him for a long time because he’s based in Los Angeles and I’m based in London, but he’s great and very talented. I have a great girl that I work with in Miami. I have someone great in London as well, but honestly, I like to try new people depending on what I’m doing.

FRAGRANCE
Diptyque is my go-to candle brand—I go back and forth between Feu de Bois and Baies. Years and years and years ago, I made a fragrance called Intimately Beckham with my husband. I really enjoyed the process of creating it. But just like with my makeup, I didn’t want to compromise and I wanted to do things my way, so about eight years ago I started working with Jérôme Épinette, who is the most amazing perfumer. I knew that I had to take my time with the fragrances we worked on—which resulted in Suite 302, San Ysidro Drive, and Portofino ’97—because independently launching a fragrance is a huge undertaking. I was in absolutely no rush.
I feel quite vulnerable when I talk about the three scents because I’d never told those stories about my personal life before. San Ysidro Drive is named after the address my family and I relocated to in 2007. Every time I smell it, it takes me back to those early days in LA. It was also where I started focusing on my fashion career. It was a very special time for me as a woman to work on myself.
Suite 302 really takes me back. I would say it’s a tribute to the love affair that David and I have with Paris. In the ‘90s, we would often sneak away to Paris—just the two of us. We would stay at the Hotel Costes. When we lived in Spain, we dropped the kids off at school one morning, and David said to me, ‘I’m going to take you somewhere for the day.’ We drove to the airport, got on a private plane, and halfway through the flight, David went into the bathroom and came back out in a tuxedo looking so handsome. He said, ‘There’s something for you to put on in the bathroom.’ There was a white dress hanging up, so I put that and some makeup on. We landed in London, and there was the chauffeur-driven car that drove us to our wedding all those years ago. We drove to the house that we used to have in North London. We had a little chapel on the grounds, and he had covered the whole chapel with flowers. My parents were there. His parents were there. We had the vicar that married us all those years ago remarry us. It was the most romantic thing that he’s ever done. Then we went back to the airport and back on the plane. I had no idea where we were going again. We landed in Paris and had a mini honeymoon that was literally 24 hours long. We stayed at The Ritz in Suite 302.

I was in the Spice Girls when David and I first met. He was living in Manchester playing for Manchester United, and he would drive down to London. We literally would meet in a car park at a restaurant called City Limits. We would sit in his car and talk and really get to know each other. A friend at the time said, ‘You know, when people find out that you two are dating, everyone is going to go crazy. There’s going to be paparazzi everywhere.’ The same friend said, ‘When people know about you, take a trip. Do something special. The first trip that you should take should be to Portofino. There’s this amazing hotel called Hotel Splendido.’ That was the first time that we ever went away together, the first time that we were on a private plane together. We had 48 hours. Up until that point, every time we saw each other, it almost felt like a stolen moment because we were both so busy. The intensity of the two of us being together for that 48 hours really was amazing. I remember the blue skies. I remember how it smelt. I remember how excited I was to be with him for the first time.
I love each one. I wear them all depending on where I’m going, who I’m with, what I’m doing, where I happen to be, and what I’m wearing. They’re all genderless. Suite 302 is my perfect date night fragrance. It’s very sexy. I love the tobacco note. It feels very elegant, very chic, and very cool. There’s just something strong, powerful, and sexy about Suite 302. During the day, I switch between Portofino and San Ysidro. I love the modern take on a rose that you get with San Ysidro and how fresh Portofino feels. You can also combine the fragrances as well, so you can almost customize them. They’re all I wear at the moment.”

Is ITG obsessed with cherries? Kind of. It started back in December at our holiday shoot. Studios are not the most, um, glamorous of places, so someone (probably Daise) had the bright idea to burn one of the candles in our gift guide early on. It was Sidia’s Pyro candle, and while we already knew it smelled good (that’s why we were shooting it!), we had no idea we’d become Pyro-crazed. It’s all we talked about all day! (Mid-morning: “Oh my God, your perfume is amazing, what is it?” “It’s the candle!” Coffee break: “Mmmm, smells like cherry candy.” One hour before wrapping: “Can you move the candle closer to me?) By the time the shoot was over, another one was planned: We needed to celebrate all things cherry.
Valentine’s Day is the perfect holiday to double down on a cherry obsession. If you’re celebrating with someone, a sexy, smooth cherry perfume is the on-the-nose complement to what can be an unwieldy saccharine day. On the other hand, if you’re alone, a cherry manicure is perfect eye candy. And then there are the lips—so many cherry lips. Scroll down to see what we mean.

You know that smoky and sweet scent your hair takes on after a post dinner drag? Of course you don’t! You’ve never even seen a cigarette, and your post dinner anything always starts and stops with sleep. But if you could use your imagination, and think up the perfect marriage between a naughty [Posh voice] waft of tobacco and leather as it meets an undercurrent of black cherry, then you’ve arrived at Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Suite 302 Eau de Parfum. Inspired by Victoria Beckham’s whirlwind anniversary trip to Paris with David Beckham, it’s warm and spicy—practically begging to be worn in a dimly-lit bar late at night. For the day, there’s Tom Ford’s Electric Cherry Eau de Parfum. It’s light and fresh—the tartness of morello cherries is offset by ginger and jasmine. Of course, not everything needs to smell like cherries! So in that case, consider these cute cherry beeswax candles from Happy Organics that smell of honey. They’re made using molds cast from actual cherries and are generally adorable.
Look, this is a cherry story—of course there’s going to be a bunch of lip products. In our opinion—and in the absence of Balm Dotcom Cherry (RIP)—the perfect cherry lip wardrobe starts off with Fenty’s Ultra-Hydrating Lip Balm, the Barbados cherry-powered balm that Rihanna made in collaboration with A$AP Rocky. For a tinted option, there’s U Beauty’s Plasma Lip in Shanghai. It’s hydrating. It’s vibrant. It plumps a little. And speaking of accentuating things, Kjaer Weis’s Lip Pencil in Faded, a slightly muted red, is a must-buy. It’s a red that’s not overwhelming. It’s also the perfect companion to Violette_FR’s Petal Bouche in Cerise Désir, a matte liquid lip that doesn’t transfer, so you can eat in peace and without touch-ups.
Sometimes you need a lipstick that’s more of an objet, which is where Westman Atelier’s Les Rouges Lip Suede Lipstick Palette comes into play. Use your pinky to create a blurred, just-kissed lip. It has a matte finish, too, but because it’s made with cold-pressed cherry oil, you don’t have to worry about your lips feeling dry. Plus, you can mix-and-match the four colors to create your perfect shade. But, if you want to keep it simple, go with a classic bullet via La Bouche Rouge’s Lipstick in Cherry Pink. And make it a monochromatic look with Tata Harper’s Cream Blush in Naughty. Pat it on and build it up as much as you want. Easy, peasy.
The best thing about a cherry manicure is that it’s never out of style. Don’t believe us? Then look no further than last week’s Top Shelf, where Rebecca Alaniz—a stylist for crying out loud—told us how her go-to polish of choice was a red one because it “goes with everything.” So on that note, Gucci’s Goldie Red lacquer is a juicy cherry that’s too glossy to pass up. Actually, so is La Bonne Brosse’s No. 2 Essential Brush. The shiny finish on the nylon and boar bristle brush gives ye olde Mason Pearson a run for its money in the “Rolls Royce of hairbrushes” category. Might we suggest giving it a whirl before cinching your hair in a cherry claw clip? Just when you think that little accessory is dunzo, it comes back with a cute upgrade. Right now the best are from Emi Jay, which hit the sweet spot in being not-too-small and not-too-big. But it’s the cherries that really make them worth your while.

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:29,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/cyndi-ramirez-fulton-chillhouse-after-dark-beauty/,2150,"“Chillhouse started off as a modern day spa concept in the Lower East Side, and over COVID, we launched a line of CPG products—from press-on nails to body care—to help people find their chill. My husband, Adam, is my COO, but he is also a partner of Garrett Group, the hospitality group that owns and operates four bars in Manhattan—Bandits, The Garrett West, Borrachito, and Rocco’s, and another Borrachito in Boston. I’m not involved in the day-to-day of those businesses, but I’m a small partner, so I’m the First Lady, we like to say.
We live in Miami full-time now. We keep a little place in New York, but we made the decision to make Miami our home base over the summer. It’s been great. We have two kids—I just had a baby—and we did the parenting thing in Manhattan with Hendrix, our three year old, but having places to go outside became really important to us. We miss New York, but it’s calmer here. We’ve begun to love it, and we’re committed for the long haul.
If I’m in New York, I like to start my nights out early. The first stop is always Bandit’s because it used to be on the way home from the office. Our night out restaurant was Raoul’s. When we’re feeling a little naughty and we’re going to have that second or third martini that we’ll regret the next day, we always end up there. That’s where we would probably end the night, but if we’re feeling frisky and want a nightcap, maybe we’d go to The Ear Inn on the way home. Lately, I’ve been on a spicy, skinny mezcal margarita kick, but I don’t feel like that’s always appropriate in New York settings. My husband is a big martini person—he drinks vespers—and I like mezcal on the rocks.
In Miami, people definitely go out a lot later, which works out for us because we like to go out early to get home at a reasonable hour. There are a lot of clubs and a lot of entertainment. The places are all very grand, but they’re not where I go at all. I wouldn’t say that there are a lot of places where we as grown adults want to hang out for two drinks before heading to dinner. We live on the beach, so we’ve been hanging out at hotel bars around here instead. I’m a member of The Standard in Miami Beach. Their Monterrey Bar is a cute, classy spot.

Our dinner spot in Miami depends on our mood. South of Fifth tends to have the bigger, fancier grownup restaurants, but they’re a splurge, so we don’t always go in that direction. Otherwise, we love Mandolin in the Design District. We really love Branja, which is in a cute outdoor shopping mall called Upper Buena Vista. Macchialina is also in our rotation. It’s a great Italian spot that’s on the beach. If we’re having a nice date night, we’ll go up to Surfside or Bal Harbor. Both areas have really nice restaurants. Makoto is one of our favorites.
I hate to say it because I’m a New Yorker, but I think Pastis Miami is one of the best restaurants here. It was one of those spaces that Miami people, I think, really needed. It has all of the charm of the original. It almost has the exact layout of the original Pastis. The menu is slightly different than the one in New York, but I find it more exciting. Overall, I like the experience better. I’ve heard a lot of people say that too; it’s not just me.
SKINCARE
First things first, I always need to rinse off the day before going out for the night. I discovered the SheaMoisture Coconut & Hibiscus Body Wash at a drugstore while I was traveling. It’s since become a mainstay in my house. I like to do a quick scrub too—I love our Under the Sea scrub. Depending on how I’m feeling, I’ll either use the Osea Undaria Collagen Body Lotion or our Have A Chill Day Body Oil. The lotion is a bit thicker, and I don’t always want something heavy on my skin. Our body oil also comes in a spray bottle, which really allows for the oil to spread out. It’s just light overall, down to the scent, which is a little citrus-y.
I keep a couple of face washes in the shower. Right now I’m obsessed with the U Beauty Skin Conditioning Wash. It’s a little more moisturizing than your typical face cleanser, and it requires a very light rinse. To take off my makeup at the end of the night, I keep the Dermalogica PreCleanse Balm, along with the Dermalogica Microfoliant, on my sink.

Once I’m out of the shower, I use our Steam Room body mist as my toner. I’m always mixing it up when it comes to serums, but right now, I’m leaving the Caudalíe Vinoperfect Radiance Serum. I like that it feels creamy, and I’ve definitely noticed my skin is brighter since I started using it.
I love a face tool, and I think our Chill Globes are great at night for tightening and snatching your face. They’re made out of stainless steel. We used to have glass ones, but people would maybe leave them in the fridge for too long and a couple of people said that they broke. Glass just wasn’t ideal.
Since it’s late at night, I don’t need to wear SPF, so I just go for the La Mer Moisturizing Soft Cream and Eye Concentrate instead. I also love the Meaningful Beauty neck and décolleté cream. It’s from Cindy Crawford’s skincare line, which uses melon antioxidants. All of the products I’ve tried from the brand are really lovely and light on the skin—nothing ever feels like it’s weighing me down—but I think the neck treatment is the best. I see an immediate difference with it—my skin looks tighter and my wrinkles are a little bit more diminished.
MAKEUP
In Miami—versus New York—I definitely like for my makeup to be a little peachier. I also wouldn’t add as much bronzer in New York.
I start with the One/Size Secure the Blur primer. I have so many One/Size products now. It’s a great line, especially for going out. The Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r is my favorite foundation—I use shade 290—but I’ve been mixing foundations recently. I just got the Westman Atelier Vital Skin Foundation Stick in Atelier X which I layer on top of the Fenty Beauty if I want slightly heavier coverage. I like to use the Merit Clean Foundation & Concealer Stick in Khaki under my eyes to cover any hyperpigmentation, in the corners of my nose, and around my lips.
I love the One/Size Cheek Clapper Palette in Rich Betch to bronze. It’s a trio of colors, two powders and one cream. I use a mix of the powders. I like to layer the Rose Inc Cheek & Lip Color in Daylily because it’s very soft and I want it to look like I have different dimensions happening on my face. But then I like a little pop of pink or peach on my cheeks, and for that, my go-to is NARS Blush in Orgasm. It’s the OG, especially for a night out because it has a little shimmer. It’s absolutely perfect.
After my blush, I start to set my makeup with the Rare Beauty setting powder. It’s super light. I’ve been using it in the same way that people use their powders to contour a little bit.

I love Sania’s Brow Bar pencil in Medium. I went to the studio once, and Sania Vucetaj, the founder, had some great tips. I used to wax my brows and have since had a hard time growing them back. Sania said that the reason they’re not growing is because we put so much skincare over our brows, so we’re not letting the hair follicles breathe. The other thing that changed the game for me—and I’ve actually been seeing a difference—is not using brow gels. My brow hairs are a little wonky, but she insists we should just brush them.
The Necessary Eyeshadow Palette in Warm Nude from Ilia is great. The colors are really nice for the daytime, but it has a couple of shimmers that you can layer on at night. I love Lineup, the dark brown shade, as my base. Makeup by Mario’s Master Crystal Reflector in Quartz is a highlighter, but I like to use it mostly on my eyes. It’s super pretty. To actually highlight, I use Fenty Beauty’s Diamond Bomb in How Many Carats?!
The One/Size Point Made eyeliner pen in Bodacious Black is by far the best eyeliner—believe me, I’ve tried them all. One/Size’s glides really well, and it hasn’t dried out on me, which I feel like a lot do. But I’ve had a hard time with mascaras recently. For some reason, my eyelashes are all over the place and none of the mascaras that I’ve been wearing lately have been able to tame them. I tried Westman Atelier’s Eye Want You mascara, and it was really nice but also very light. It’s not a nighttime option for me. For an evening where you want your eyelashes to really pop, I’d go with Lancôme’s Monsieur Big mascara. You have to be patient with it and do a lot of layers, but it does the trick. Honestly, I’ve been looking into false eyelashes because I've been so frustrated with the mascara process.
Lately, I’ve been using Pat McGrath’s PermaGel lip pencil in Divine Rose. I love a rosy lip—that’s my everyday. That pencil is super soft and doesn’t cake. Violette_FR’s Bisou Balm in Bêtise is so beautiful. It’s a good layerable lipstick. I top it off with Tower 28’s Lip Jelly in Pistachio. It’s my favorite gloss. Ami Colé’s Lip Treatment Oil in Smitten, a bright pink, is good, too.
To set everything, I use One/Size’s On 'Til Dawn setting spray. It looks like an aerosol can, and it's very satisfying to spray it on your face.
HAIR
I am terrible with my hair. I’ve tried to get better over time, but I’m just so lazy with it. Especially when I’m going out at night, it’s too long of a process to take a shower, wash my hair, and get ready. I generally just take a hot tool to my dirty hair and curl a few pieces—the Drybar Tress Press straightening iron is good for both curling or flattening. That’s usually the extent of it. If anything, maybe I’ll add a little Crown Affair hair oil to give it some shine and some OUAI Texturizing hair spray for a quick fix of sorts.

NAILS
Our Chillhouse Tipsy Tinsel press-on nails are perfect for the day and going out. The base is pearly, but then they have a chrome wave across for the perfect little bit of sparkle. They’re my go-to for the nighttime. We launched our press-ons in mid-2020, which was very early in the press-on wave. It’s getting crazier and more crowded for sure. This year, we’ll be heavily diversifying our Chill Tips assortment, adding different lengths, shapes, textures, colors, and designs. I don’t ever want to just give you a red nail; everything has to have that Chillhouse twist.
FRAGRANCE
While I’m getting ready, I like to burn our Meet Me in the Lobby candle. It’s literally designed to smell like a sexy hotel lobby so it’s perfect for getting ready at night because it gets you in the mood. It has white amber, musk, and oud.
Diptyque has a lot of scents that I love, but I went to their store recently to buy a home fragrance and walked out with L’Eau Papier. The girl at the register said to me, ‘This is the best scent ever. Don’t tell anyone, but it’s amazing.’ I spritzed myself and fell in love. It’s so intoxicating, maybe because it has white musk and blond wood accords. It reminds me of another perfume that I bought in France, but I feel like I could actually wear this one during the day, too because it’s not as rich and heavy.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:35,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/hannah-baxter-anxiety-beer-beauty-routine/,3138,"More Hannah! In Part I of the beauty editor’s Top Shelf, she walked ITG through her career path and over-the-top skincare routine. Now she’s on to makeup, hair, nails, and fragrance. Get comfy! It’s going to be a long, but very good ride.
MAKEUP
I don’t really wear foundation and concealer that often, but when I do, I really like Glossier’s Stretch Balm Concealer. It’s very lightweight and easy to sheer out, and it works well for under the eyes and doesn’t settle into creases. I use shade Light 2. I’ve also seen so many makeup artists use the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, so when I think of concealer, that’s what comes to mind. It’s the OG. I use shade Light 2.5. When I want a more full-coverage option, I grab the Kulfi Hydrating Concealer. It perfectly covers any breakouts and smooths everything out. It’s creamy without being greasy, which is hard to accomplish.
A few years ago I brought ILIA’s Super Serum Skin Tint to a friend’s wedding on a cruise ship, even though I’d never used it before. I remember putting it on in the really horribly-lit ship bathroom, and it looked fucking amazing. It’s so easy to apply and doesn’t require a technique whatsoever. I use shade Formosa. If I have a big patch of melasma, I use Westman Atelier’s Vital Skin Foundation Stick in Atelier 0.5. It took me a while to figure out how to use it, but it’s a really nice formula that’s buildable and doesn’t settle into fine lines. And while I love to be super shiny, sometimes I need to tone it down. Tatcha’s Silk Setting Powder is great, but I recently discovered Ware’s PoreBoy. It’s a stick formula that tampens down the shine. It’s so easy to use.
Blush is my favorite makeup product of all time. I like putting a little bit on my forehead, so it looks like I’m sunburnt without actually being sunburnt. I have every color of the Westman Atelier Baby Cheeks Blush Stick and I just rotate them based on how sallow my skin is looking. Merit’s Flush Balm Cream Blush is also nice to apply. I especially like Mood, a really dark burgundy color that gives you this post-sex sort of flush. Clé de Peau Beauté’s Cream Blush in Joyful Pink is another blush pot and lasts a really long time. The only powder blush that I have is Dior’s Rosy Glow in Coral, which is low-key a favorite color to wear of mine. It looks bright orange in the palette, but it’s flawless and looks great in the summer.

I love bronzer because I love being tan. The Chanel Les Beige Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream in 390 Soleil Tan Bronze? I use that shit everywhere. It looks really natural and the pot lasts such a long time, too. I do a little bit of contouring on my cheeks with the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. The position of our contour changes with every trend cycle, so I’m still trying to figure it out, but I have good cheekbones and I’m just trying to make them pop a little bit.
In middle school, I was emo to the core, so my eyeliner look very much was like a racoon’s. Now I only line my upper waterline. Lisa Eldridge’s Seamless Glide Eye Pencil is so pigmented. It’s like a Sharpie—but safe. And the Victoria Beckham Satin Kajal Liner? Let’s be honest—Posh made a good liner. I like it in Navy Noir. When I was bartending full time at Webster Hall, I would go in with a full cat-eye, so I’m pretty decent at getting liquid liner on me. The Danessa Myricks Beauty Linework Paintbrush Fluid Eyeliner is excellent. It has a thin tip and goes on super black.
I didn’t use an eye primer for a long time, but I saw the error of my ways when my shadow started to crease. Urban Decay’s Primer Potion is my go-to. If I’m going for a ‘fancier’ makeup look, I swear by Urban Decay’s 24/7 Eyeshadow Stick in Freak, an acid green that I like to apply around the inner corner of my eye to halfway down my lids. I have hazel eyes, so it brings out the green. It also takes two seconds. The Pat McGrath Labs Mothership V Palette also has an iridescent green shadow that I wear. I’m almost out of it, and I’m so bummed that you can’t buy her shades in singles. I don’t know what it is about green, but it makes me feel interesting and confident. I’m a real believer that makeup is supposed to be fucking fun. While I love sculpting my cheekbones, I also want put on some fucking glitter. I want color. I want fun. I want silliness.
Joey Healy shapes and tints my brows every six months or so. I do like a bushy brow look, and I like Joey’s Brow Structure Clear set to keep them brushed up. I think that the Kimiko Super Fine Eyebrow Pencil Automatique is a sleeper hit in the brow industry. Danielle Kimiko Vincent, the founder, does Sandra Oh’s brows, and she is so talented. The pencil only comes in one shade, a sort of gray, but it’s super fine. You can draw individual hairs very well. The KS&Co Tinted Brow Gel is also a dream. It doesn’t deposit too much color, but it thickens up the hairs.
I have blonde eyelashes, so I need to darken them. Armani’s Eyes to Kill Classico is my little black dress of mascara. It lengthens. It gives you Bambi eyes. I like it so much that I didn’t want to like Gucci’s Mascara L’Obscur, but it nails it every single time. It pains me to say it, but it’s worth the money. The same goes for Victoria Beckham Beauty’s Future Lash Mascara. When it comes to ‘clean’ options, getting rid of all of the nasties in mascaras has come so far. I bounce back and forth between Tower 28 MakeWaves and Saie’s Mascara 101.

I feel the most myself with a lip. I hate to be such a cliche, but it feels very French to me to just have a bold lip with a bare face. Hermès’s lipstick in Orange Boite is a sheer-ish orange-red. It looks crazy in the bullet—like a carrot—but it’s perfect. Rouge Casaque is my bad bitch red. If I need to close a deal, that’s the one I’m wearing. Meanwhile, Byredo’s lipstick in Divorce is my sexy red. I love the whole Chanel Rouge Coco Baume line—the balms are super moisturizing. Dream is my flawless color. It’s a perfect burnt rosy—like your lips but better. Merit’s Shade Slick Tinted Lip Oil also has a beautiful formula.
I discovered Sunnies Face when I was in Korea shopping in Myeongdong. Their Lip Treat in Girl Crush, a warm rose, and Poppy, a reddish orange, are perfect. They have a lovely consistency. I have every single color from Sisley’s Lipstick Phyto-Rouge Shine line—they’re fucking flawless—but I especially love Sheer Blossom, Sheer Petal, and Sheer Ginger. For balms, they stay on so long. Every woman in my family uses the Burt’s Bees Tinted Lip Balm in Rose. I have one in every bag I own, and they’re only $5. Chanel’s N°1 de Chanel Lip and Cheek Balm helps me look not dead, and I also have the Zelens Lip Enhancer. It’s one of those balms that adjusts to the pH of your lips. Remember when Smashbox had the O-Gloss? It’s like that but a little bit fancier.
HAIR
My mom went gray extremely early. My entire life I only knew her with silver hair, which is amazing because it reminds me that going gray is not the worst thing in the world. The pandemic really sparked me going gray very rapidly though. I had one or two grays that I could pluck up until that point, and now, I have a full on silver streak—I call it my power streak. I’ve been going to Colleen Flaherty for my blonde for the past five or six years. I see her every four months or so, and we’re slowly starting to let my gray come through a little bit more because there’s no stopping it.
When I had a bob—I had one for five years—I went to Erickson A at Bumble and Bumble. I love him because he’s great at working with textured hair. Lately though, Dhiran Mistry has been my go-to. My hair grows out really well anytime I go to him.
I’ve been going to the Harklinikken Clinic because I lost a lot of hair last year. I was having a really stressful summer, and I was losing a Pomeranian’s worth of hair every time I showered. Then, of course, losing your hair makes you more stressed and your cortisol levels rise and it becomes a vicious cycle. I use Harklinikken’s serum when my hair is 90 percent dry. I also use their Stabilizing Scalp Shampoo and Daily Hair Conditioner, which is sort of a bummer because I want to test a bunch of stuff, but I do feel like they’re working. My hair’s starting to grow back, especially around my temples. That said, I’m generally not loyal to a lot of shampoo and conditioners. I love the Crown Affair Ritual Shampoo and Conditioner. The conditioner in particular is so creamy.

I love how accessible Odele is as a whole. Their Clarifying Shampoo is so good. The Oribe Hair Alchemy Resilience Shampoo and Conditioner are really great for blondes in particular. I also use the Olaplex No.4P Blonde Enhancer Toning Shampoo once a week because my hair tends to get brassy really quickly. Plus, my dad’s a redhead, so I have some red undertones and I don’t like that. And because I live in New York and the water is hard, I have the Canopy Filtered Showerhead, which I feel like helps keep my blonde really bright.
Because I have textured and colored hair, it can get really dry, so I always use Crown Affair’s Leave-In-Conditioner or Living Proof’s Restore Repair Leave-In when I get out of the shower. The process goes: I get out of the shower, add a leave-in, put in some JVN Complete Air Dry Cream, which helps with frizz, and Ceremonia Pequi Curl Activator. It’s my holy grail curl product. I have really fine 2A-2B waves, and everything that I’d come across for curls up until that point was too creamy and weighed down my hair. The Activator is a sort of gel-serum hybrid. Honestly, I love everything from Ceremonia. Babba Canales, the founder, did such a beautiful job catering to people with curlier hair. I use the Guava Rescue Spray for heat protection, too. And then I use the Rōz Santa Lucia Styling Oil on my ends.
I’m really lazy with hair masks, but they’re nice to have as an extra treat. Odele’s Moisture Mask is a favorite. It took me a long time to get on the K18 Leave-in Molecular Repair Hair Mask train because you can’t use conditioner with it and that feels like sacrilege for textured hair, but I do feel like it helps with split ends and preventing breakage since I’m bleaching it all the time. I use it once a month.
I feel very elegant and put together when I have a snatched, Bella Hadid bun, even though it is really bad for your hair. But because I have rogue baby hairs from all of the regrowth, I have a lot of frizz. I swear by the Mielle Organics Honey & Ginger Edge Gel. That shit will shellac your hair down. Just use an old toothbrush, and it fucking works. It can be windy, it can be raining, and your hair’s not going anywhere. You do have to shampoo really hard to get it out though.
I only properly brush my hair before I get in the shower. Cim Mahony gave me a Mason Pearson pocket brush when I was in Copenhagen. Actually, that’s a funny story. I went on a press trip to Stockholm, and then I flew from Stockholm to Copenhagen for eight hours just to get my hair dyed. It was probably the best blonde I’ve ever had in my life. Now I'm obsessed with this new French brand, La Bonne Brosse, for a very chic alternative to the Mason Pearson.—I use the No. 2 brush. On my wet hair, I use Crown Affair’s Comb No. 002 to brush my leave-in through.
I’m a big proponent of air drying, but it’s not always feasible. Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer with the diffuser attachment works the fastest. It minimizes the frizz. And the Amika High Tide Beach Waver Curling Iron is my secret weapon for getting my waves—it lifts up the roots and it’s easy to use. I rarely enjoy getting my hair blown out because it looks too precious, but Mark Towsend always gives me a great blow out. He does Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen’s hair, so he just gets it. If I flat iron my hair, which is very rare these days, I use the T3 Smooth ID Smart Flat Iron.

NAILS
Getting my nails done is one of my favorite affordable luxuries. I live around the corner from a cute nail salon, Elements Beauty Lounge, which was always a goal for me in New York. For a fancier manicure, I’m the biggest fan of JinSoon. It’s so calming.
I like doing my own manicures—not pedicures—and I got really good during the pandemic. Generally, I like a shorter, oval-shaped nail. When they’re too long, it’s too hard to type. I love the Chanel nail file to shape them. The Bare Hands Dry Gloss Manicure Kit is perfect, too. It comes with a glass file and cuticle oil.
In terms of colors, I love JinSoon’s Palma. It’s an electric Kelly green. JinSoon’s Cool Blue is an Yves Klein blue. Actually, I really like getting ugly colors on my nails. JinSoon’s Charme looks disgusting—kind of like baby vomit—but in a fashionable way. It’s like an electric yellow, slimy green, and I really, really love it. Chanel’s 953 Essentiel [discontinued] is like a toffee brown. And every time I get Essie’s Yes, I Canyon, I feel flawless. It’s the perfect orange-red.
FRAGRANCE
I switch up my scent depending on the season, my mood, and the time of day—what I wear in the morning is not necessarily what I'm going to wear at night. I gravitate towards woody scents. I love amber, salt, and rose. I think rose gets a bad rap as being an old lady scent—it can be really sexy when done right. In the summer, I love Ellis Brooklyn’s SALT. It smells like the seaside, like if you’ve just been outside playing by the beach. And it gets better when you sweat into it. Fueguia 1833 is a recent find of mine. All of the brand’s scents are beautiful, but Cactus Azul is a very sharp but earthy scent. It’s clean and dry and smells better the longer you wear it. Actually, it reminds me of what a post-sex smell would be—in a nice way—like just something from inside your body. I really love the ethos behind D.S. & Durga’s Bistro Waters. It has green pepper, mandarin, moss water, and nutmeg. It’s savory and complex.
L'Eau Papier is one of Diptyque’s newer scents. People always ask me about it when I wear it. You wouldn't think that a page of a book would inspire a very attractive scent because, I think, you’d either love or hate that. But it’s very fresh and bright and lighter than you would expect.
I wrote a story diving deep into how smells and aromacology can actually affect your mood, so I love the idea of a functional fragrance. Mind Energy from The Nue Co. is really uplifting. I wear it a lot when I have a big day of events. Does it actually give me more energy? I don't know, but it appeals to something in me and I know that I should have more energy by wearing it, so I feel better.

Lover by The Maker is the perfume that gets me the most comments. It’s just really cozy and delicious in a way that makes you want to smell it again. It makes you want to be in a dark hotel amongst velvet with soft candle lighting. Krigler’s Boudoir Renaissance 223 is really well-balanced. It’s somewhat floral but earthy. It’s rich but not too musky. It’s sort of slinky. It’s another good date night perfume. It’s a mouthwatering one.
I’m a fucking candle freak. I know that they're not the best for you, but you pick your battles. I mean, I inject botulinum toxin into my face on a regular basis, so yeah, I’m going to light a candle. I can’t even tell you what Nette’s Safari really smells like—I mean the notes are suede, violet leaves, and moss—but it’s just so good. And again, I love rose, and there’s something very elegant about Diptyque’s Roses. I also love Baies. That’s the classic one.
I love Matthew Herman and David Kien, the boys behind Boy Smells. I remember writing about them when they launched their Kush candle. It was one of my first big beauty profiles that I did, so they're very near and dear to my heart. I now really love the Spirituous candle, the votive especially. I like that it's lit up by the flame.
I’ve gone through a lot of Byredo Woods candles. I grew up on a farm and having any sort of land around me makes me feel very humble, and I love carrying that feeling through a candle. The same goes for D.S. & Durga’s Big Sur After Rain. I have the hand soap of it, too.
It's always a conversation piece to have a cannabis candle in your home. I'm a cannabis user, and you can elevate that shit and make it into a candle. It’s earthy and blends well with the smells of a home. I love Malin + Goetz’s.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:38,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/empress-of-for-your-consideration-tour-beauty-routine/,1051,"“I’m getting ready to go on tour to support my fourth album, For Your Consideration. I think it’s sonically one of my most fun records. Heartbreak and relationships were major inspirations for my last albums, but this one is so flirty and sexy and makes me feel good in my body. It’s the perfect single-era album; I feel hot when I listen to it. You’re going to want to put it on when you’re doing your makeup.
Getting ready is really meditative for me. I like the stillness of it before the chaos, especially now that I’m going to more events and red carpets as an artist. If I have the luxury of taking my time, I have a playlist that’s six hours long and filled with music that pumps me up. It has a ton of bops from people like Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, and Kate Bush.
I’ve definitely gotten better at doing my own looks since I don’t always have a makeup artist on tour with me. I’ve learned so much from TikTok and Instagram. It’s a creative process. I love asking myself who I want to be that night, but the goal is always to feel more confident when I’m on stage.
SKINCARE
The biggest thing I’ve learned from watching makeup artists—I love working with Nick Lennon, Alexandra French, and Marla Vazquez—is that skin prep is so important. When I’m getting ready for the night, I start off with The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5. It feels good on my skin, but I also like it because of the price point; it’s just under $10. I really like the Osea Essential Hydrating Oil because it’s really light and actually absorbs into the skin. It smells really nice, kind of sweet and fruity. And the Osea Ocean Eye Serum is great, too. The Augustinus Bader Cream is painfully expensive but very worth the investment. When I run out, I try to convince myself to use other moisturizers, but then they never live up to it. It’s just very hydrating and calming for my skin. It sinks in well—but I really hate spending $300 on it.

MAKEUP
I’m just so happy to have nailed one makeup look that I keep doing it over and over again—a little bit of contour on my cheeks, forehead, and nose, and a snatched, chocolate-y eye look. I started using Urban Decay’s Eyeshadow Primer because it makes colors pop more on stage, not to mention I’m constantly moving and sweating. I love Urban Decay’s Naked3 Palette, too. I actually use the darkest color to line my eyes. The MAC In Extreme Dimension 3D Mascara is another classic. I like a messy, 60s mascara look sometimes, and I can really get that look with it because the wand picks up a lot of product.
If Armani ever reads this, please sponsor me. [Laughs] I love their Luminous Silk Foundation. It’s so good. I’ve heard from some makeup artists that foundation is really skin-dependent, and this one has really worked for me for years. I use shade 9.
The Charlotte Tilbury Glow Cream Bronzer in 2 Medium is the best in the game. I see it in every makeup artist’s kit. It’s so subtle and very pretty. I contour with the Fenty Beauty Contour Match Stix in Mocha. It’s so easy to make lines with them, especially around the nose.
All of Rare Beauty’s products are sick, but I keep buying the Melting Cream Blush in Nearly Berry. It’s so pigmented and it’s a fun size, so you can carry it in your purse and just use your finger to dab it on your cheeks when you need a re-up. Ilia’s DayLite Highlighting Powder in Decades is so great for the edge of the nose and cheekbones. It’s just slightly shimmery, so it’s not at all overwhelming.  And red lips make me feel really good. I love combining NARS Lip Liner in African Queen and NARS Pure Matte Lipstick in 414 BLKR. I set everything with the Laura Mercier Translucent Setting Powder. It blurs everything in a really pretty and natural way.

HAIR
I usually put extensions in my hair when I play a lot of shows. They really add to the drama—and it’s great to have hair to whip around. Antoine Martinez does my hair sometimes, and I’m nowhere near as good as he is, but I put in my own extensions now. I just try to imitate what he does. Then I go in with my Hot Tools ¾” 24K Gold Curling Iron. I like using EcoStyler’s Olive Oil Styling Gel to tame the top of my head because I don’t like big, frizzy, curly hair. I was actually really surprised when I saw that my stylist was using it because it’s like $4, but hey, if it works, it works.
FRAGRANCE
When I’m getting ready, I love lighting Astier de Villate’s Palais de Tokyo Incense. That’s such a ‘me moment,’ and it makes my place smell like a really nice hotel lobby, which makes me feel luxurious. I get so many compliments when I wear Debaser from D.S. & Durga. It has coconut milk, iris, and bergamot. The brand describes it as ‘hot, humid, and sexy,’ kind of like my album. [Laughs] I layer it with my Nuxe Dry Oil. I had seen it on so many people’s dressers, and I finally bought it when I played a show in Paris. It’s a classic, and the older I get the more that I want classic products. I mean, I won’t wear Chanel. No. 5, but I do like the idea of it.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:40,https://intothegloss.com/2024/02/gabriela-berlingeri-diciembre-veintinueve-beauty-routine/,1456,"“I’ve always wanted to have my own brand, but I thought I would start with swimsuits since I grew up in Puerto Rico and so much of my life is spent on the beach. But then I started working with a local jewelry company and learned how to create my own designs. I’m inspired by the ocean, the sand, and the seashells, and there were certain pieces that I wanted for myself that I didn’t see anywhere. That’s how Diciembre Veintinueve started. We’ve become known for our sun necklace—I have a little obsession with sunsets. I’ve actually seen a lot of people wearing it during nights out.
Going out in Puerto Rico is intense because it’s so hot. You really have to plan out what you’re going to do with your hair and what you’re going to wear so you’re comfortable. A night out for me usually means going to a bar; I’m not into fancy places. In San Juan we have La Placita de Santurce, but it’s a little bit too touristy, so I try to get away from it. There’s Calle Loíza and Calle Cerra, which are streets with a lot of bars that are all within walking distance. There’s where more of the locals go—but you have to speak Spanish or the bartenders will know you’re not from here. I love this little bar called La Chilleria. They put on very good music—if you want to ask for a song, they’ll play it, too—but you can’t go with too many people because it’s very small. Oh, and they have hookah. It can get a little wild there, so if I want more of a chill night, I’ll go to La Disquera. They have a lot of vinyls. On Calle Loíza, there’s a place called Roofyard. It’s on a rooftop and they have great drinks.
SKINCARE
Every skincare product I use was recommended by my dermatologist. I don’t always know what it’s doing honestly, but if she tells me to do it, I do it. So when I’m getting ready to put on makeup, I always grab the same three products: Alastin Restorative Skin Complex, Alastin Ultra Light Moisturizer, and SkinCeuticals Phyto A+ Brightening Treatment Lightweight Moisturizer. Hydration is always the goal. The same goes for my body because I’m always in the sun and it can get a bit dry. The Vaseline Intensive Care Nourishing Moisture Lotion is so good. It leaves my skin very glowy and makes it look very rich. For an extra glow, I like to layer Baja Zen’s Coco Glow Body Glow Oily. Someone gave it to me for my birthday recently. It smells amazing, kind of like coconut and pineapple. You smell like a walking piña colada, in a good way. [Laughs]

MAKEUP
Primer is essential in Puerto Rico. Milk Makeup’s Hydro Grip Gripping Primer is great—your makeup doesn’t budge at all. If I forget to apply it, I’ll wash my face and start over. I don’t care if I’m late.
I like to mix Drunk Elephant’d D-Bronzi Anti-Pollution Sunshine Drops with the Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech Foundation—I use shade 200 Light Medium Neutral—especially if I’m a little tan. The foundation feels so light on your skin and you don’t need a lot of it, so it never feels cakey. I have zero complaints. For bronzer, I like to use the Makeup by Mario Soft Sculpt Shaping Stick in Medium. I like to wear it on my forehead and sometimes on my neck. Honestly, I don’t know if I’m using it correctly, but if it looks good, I guess it works. [Laughs]
I use blush to make it look like I got a sunburn, so I put it on my cheeks, under my eyes and on my forehead. Those are the areas that get color when I go to the beach, and I’m always trying to recreate the look. Like, I want to look like I left the beach, took a bath, and then just walked out. Patrick Ta’s Major Headlines Crème & Powder Blush Duo in She’s Blushing is my go-to. I actually like to blend it with my concealer. Most of the time, I only use concealer to cover up spots, but I might wear more if I’m going to a club and it’ll be a long night. I went on a journey trying to find the best one, and I landed on Makeup by Mario’s SurrealSkin Awakening Concealer. It’s so creamy and doesn’t crease. I use shade 200 Light Medium Neutral. Then I set it with the powder from Patrick Ta’s Major Sculpt Crème Contour & Powder Bronzer Duo. I usually have She’s Sculpted around. After that, I like Charlotte Tilbury’s Airbrush Flawless Finish Setting Powder in shade 1 Fair for my T-zone and around my mouth.

Too Faced’s Better Than Chocolate Eye Shadow Palette has a lot of bronzy colors. I use the matte shades with a brush, and if I want to add any of the sparkly ones, I use my finger because I get more product that way. I like to use shadow as eyeliner, too. I find that it usually works better and stays on longer than actual eyeliner. I do like Huda Beauty’s Life Liner if I want to make my eyes pop more though.
I love Wonderskin’s Lip Tint in the shade Lovely. It’s blue, but when you take it off, you have the most perfect, natural stain. I bought three of the same color—it’s that good. You don’t have to wear lipstick after, but I like to top it off with the Make Up For Ever’s Brow, Eye & Lip Liner in the shade Anywhere Caffeine. It’s actually the same color as my lips. I like to outline them and then fill in the middle, and they look so plump. Then I add the Dior Lip Glow Oil in 20 Mahogany on top. If I don’t have that one around, I’ll grab the Clarins Lip Comfort Oil Shimmer in Honey.
I don’t pluck or touch my eyebrows at all since I had them microbladed two years ago, so honestly, I usually forget to do my brows when I’m going out. But if I do use something, it’s the Makeup Revolution Soap Styler Stick to brush them up a bit.
Yves Saint Laurent’s Lash Clash in Uninhibited Brown is my go-to mascara. The brown makes my eyes pop, and the brush really extends your lashes and makes them look very long. It’s not waterproof, but I’ve worn it to the beach and it didn’t run.
And then the One/Size On ’Til Dawn Setting Spray is like concrete on your face. That sounds harsh, but it’s amazing. Nothing is coming off. I’ve gone out and come back to my house looking the same.

FRAGRANCE
Recently, I’ve been going back and forth between two perfumes. Jo Malone’s Scarlet Poppy is so soft and cozy. If I want something stronger, I’ll go with Carolina Herrera’s Good Girl Blush. It’s also a warm floral, but it’s mixed with vanilla. It’s really long-lasting.
NAILS
I’m very basic when it comes to my clothing, so when it comes to my nails, I go all out. Keishla Marie at Intus Nails & Hair Studio does them perfectly. I used to get square tips, but I’ve been doing almond recently. I get tired of the same design, so I tend to change them pretty often. For my 30th birthday in late December, I got a French manicure with lots of colored crystals.
HAIR
With the humidity in Puerto Rico, my hair can get really big. I try to work with that, so I make little waves for a lived-in messy look with the Conair Infiniti PRO 1-inch to ½-inch Curling Wand—ironing it would just never work. I dry it first with the Dyson Supersonic Hair Dryer. Color Wow’s Dream Coat Supernatural Spray is a big help too, but if you run into me during a night out, you’ll see me constantly touching my hair and trying to fix it. [Laughs] The humidity is no joke.”

inToGloss,4/26/2024,17:04:42,https://intothegloss.com/2024/03/lauren-perez-waltzer-anablue-hair-beauty-routine/,2184,"“I’ve been surrounded by fashion my whole life. My parents are in the industry, and I would go to showrooms with them growing up. My uncle started a big brand in the ‘80s called Rampage. I remember being in the warehouse and going monkey bar to monkey bar with the clothing racks. I naturally thought that’s what I wanted to do myself. Luckily, I was able to work in the family business, which dealt with wholesale fashion, but as I grew up, I realized I wanted something different for myself. I knew I didn't necessarily want to be a designer but I still wanted to be in that realm, so I started my consultancy firm, Here Four You. I do everything from creative direction to marketing and brand strategy. When people ask, ‘What do you do?’ I always make a joke and say, ‘Whatever you need me to do. That's why it’s called Here Four You.’ Alo Yoga was one of my first clients. I launched the first store 10 years ago with the founders, Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge. Other clients include Bandier, Good American, FRAME, and Khy, Kylie Jenner’s fashion brand.
Working with all of these brands has been so helpful in taking my own hair company, Anablue, from bottle to market. I’ve really seen the level of detail needed to scale a company. In a way, I’ve been training for this my whole life. I grew up making my own hair concoctions with oils my dad gotten from Morocco. Meanwhile, my mom and I spent Saturdays making scrubs and lotions in our kitchen, and now, all three products—the Treatment Oil, the Scalp Cleanser, and the Hair Serum—are a direct result of those experiments.
SKINCARE
When you become pregnant, you have to take a look at every ingredient in your products because there are a lot you can’t use. You also get new skin conditions—I had melasma with my first pregnancy, and I’m dealing with it again now that I’m pregnant with my baby girl. I know there are all of these lasers to help, but last time, the melasma spots faded on their own, so I’m hoping that’s the case this time, too.
I pretty much always have the same skincare products on my shelves. I love the Image Ormedic Balancing Facial Cleanser. It soaps but it’s not foamy and it makes me feel really clean. SkinCeuticals’s C E Ferulic was one of the first products that I learned about when I was building a more ‘adult’ skincare routine, and I’ve loved it ever since. It makes me very glowy. It’s definitely expensive, but it lasts.
You know how the dad in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' uses Windex for everything? Avène’s Cicalfate Restorative Skin Cream is my Windex. If I have a zit, I put it on. If I pick at a blemish, I put it on. Scar? Burn? Put it on. I don’t even really know what it’s actually for. I have just used it my whole life. Weleda’s Skin Food Cream has been more of a ‘recent’ discovery for me—I like to wear it overnight. It’s funny because when I told my friends about it, they were like, ‘Oh. I use that all the time.’ I was like, ‘Why didn't you tell me!?’

Rhode’s Glazing Milk is the one product I definitely use if I know I’m going to put on makeup because it gives you this really smooth base. It’s also really great when you’re traveling because it’s so hydrating. And then I’m in love with everything from OSEA. I always have their Hand Cream by the side of my bed. I keep one in my purse, too. It’s really the best. The Undaria Algae Body Oil is especially great because it absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. I’ve tried other oils that made me feel sticky for hours, but I put OSEA’s oil on right as I get out of the shower when my skin is still moist and then I can put on clothes within five minutes. Since I’m pregnant, I’ve been adding an extra layer of moisture with the TYBalm. It’s made by my friend Tyson Solomon. It’s so good and made with all organic and vegan ingredients.
And then I’ve tried a lot of different sunscreens, but the one that I love the most is Acure’s Radically Rejuvenating SPF Day Cream—it’s not sticky at all and goes on super smoothly. For my body, I like Avène’s Mineral Body Lotion SPF 50.
MAKEUP
The goal with my makeup is always to enhance what I have and to look like I’m glowing and have my shit together. My features are pretty dark and I have a lot of freckles, so the second I put on too much product, I feel like I’m just painting over my face and I hate it.
I do have melasma patches that need some coverage, but I try to be as light-handed as possible. I love the Kylie Power Plush Concealer in 3N and 4W. It gives you full coverage without having to use a lot of it. I always dot a little under my eyes with my fingers and buff it out with a Kylie Concealer Brush. I don’t like beauty sponges. They absorb too much product, and no matter how hard I try, I can never get them fully clean. If you think about it, it’s kind of gross. They’re also not cheap.
Chanel’s Les Beiges Bronzing Cream is a fan-favorite for a reason. The formula is super dewy and really melts into your skin without feeling heavy. It’s so good. I love to use shade Soleil Tan Bronze on my eyes actually. I don’t love when my eyes look too dark or too shimmery, but I do put a bit of the Chanel Multi-Use Glow Stick in Sculpting or Dragée on top of the bronzer. My eyes are naturally really big, and I feel like this combination opens them up even more. I fluctuate a lot with mascara, but Maybelline’s Great Lash is amazing.

I also love everything from Charlotte Tilbury, but especially her Cheek To Chic Blushes. I like to put Pillow Talk Original on my nose and my cheekbones and blend it up, kind of into my forehead. I love that the color is not too pink. It looks really natural on me. In the summer, I might add a second blush for intensity. Kylie’s Pressed Blush Powder in Winter Kisses is great. It’s easy to carry and really lasts. If I’m walking into a room and feel like I need to have a little something on my face, I’ll dab on some of the powder. Oh, and I also put a little bit of the Chanel Glow Stick on my nose and blend them together for a shimmery pink look.
Charlotte Tilbury’s Lip Cheat Lip Liner in Pillow Talk is a bit darker than the natural color of my lips, so it really helps create the illusion that my lips are a little bigger than they actually are. It also lasts forever without bleeding or getting sticky—makeup artist Mary Phillips taught me how to line them. And then I love all of Rhode’s Peptide Lip Tints, but I especially gravitate towards Toast and Espresso. The formula isn’t sticky at all. I’m constantly reapplying it because I love the way it feels on my lips. And I always have the original Peptide Lip Treatment in my purse. It’s so hydrating and light—I’ve put my husband on it. I’ve put my brothers on it. It’s amazing.
HAIR 
I treat my hair the same way most people treat their face. The hair industry is all about repair, but I’m all about prevention. To that end, I’ve never dyed my hair. Growing up, it was instilled in me that my hair is tied to where I come from, my family, and my Moroccan culture. My dad would have killed me if I had dyed it or fully cut it off. My mom is also Moroccan but she’s blonde, and she would always tell me, ‘You have the most beautiful color. Never touch it.’
I get a haircut every six weeks. My hair grows pretty quickly, but I’m also a big advocate of getting regular cuts; I think it’s the only way to prevent split ends. People are so scared to cut it—and I get it—but they don’t realize that trimming it won’t change anything besides giving them healthy hair. I have this beautiful stylist, Rita Gili, come to my house. She was actually my husband’s stylist first, but she really understands my hair.

Prior to founding Anablue, I was constantly trying to find the best products on the market that were ‘clean.’ When I began formulating my line, I wanted to start off with the perfect three-step routine that covers your basic necessities. All of the products have argan oil, which helps with hair hydration and scalp health. I always start my routine by putting the Treatment Oil on my scalp all the way to my ends. Sometimes I leave it overnight—or longer—and rinse it out in the morning, but you can leave it in as little as 30 minutes. Then I use the Scalp Cleanser to wash out the oil. It gently exfoliates your scalp to encourage new hair growth. Our scalp truly is like our skin; if you don’t exfoliate it, you’re going to have dead skin and clogged pores. I recommend using the Cleanser once a week but no more than twice. I don’t love using my fingers to wash my hair honestly; I just feel like I can never get every part of my head with my hands. I really love my Scalp Massager. Massagers in general are great for simulating blood flow in your scalp, which promotes hair growth. I use it all of the time, both on dry and wet hair. And I don’t use conditioner after since the argan in the Treatment Oil acts as a natural conditioner.
Your hair is so fragile when it’s wet, so I use a Reverie Good Detangling Hair Brush, which has the same prongs as my scalp massager. It doesn’t pull my hair at all. That said, I never really use it on wet hair. Since my hair is wavy, I want it to settle into its natural pattern. If it gets knotty, I add in our Hair Serum to smooth it out. You can really have fun and use it anytime you want. And it doesn’t have silicone, which makes me very proud.

If I’m styling it or need to put my hair up, I love Emi Jay’s Big Effing Clips and Slip’s Skinny Silk Scrunchies—silk-anything is better for your hair overall. I also have Slip Silk Pillowcases to prevent dryness and even fallout. They’re a great little addition to your hair care routine.
NAILS
I don’t have time to get my nails done once a week and I can’t stand showing up somewhere with my nails undone, so the easiest thing is to get a gel manicure every couple of weeks. I’ve been going to Long Tran at Nature Nails for 10 years. He’s traveled from salon to salon, and I’ve followed him everywhere. I wear a pair of UV protection gloves when I see him. I have them cut really short right now. Actually, it’s so funny because Long made fun of me when I cut my nails. I had the longest and pointiest nails when I had [my son] Snow, but then I had this ‘aha’ moment where I realized, ‘Wait, this is kind of gross.’ Like, washing dishes felt wrong with long nails all of a sudden. I was also worried that I was going to poke him in the eye. Long now looks at me and goes, ‘You’ve changed ever since you had your baby.’
FRAGRANCE
I don’t really use perfumes. I didn’t grow up seeing my mom use them so they never became a part of my daily routine. But I love the smell of flowers in my home—especially gardenias. I want people to feel like they’re walking through a garden—maybe with undertones of citrus—when they visit me. Diptyque makes beautiful floral-scented candles that aren’t so intense. Roses is a classic. It’s also a great gift. The same goes for Flamingo Estate’s Night Blooming Jasmine & Damask Rose Candle. It’s floral but refreshing at the same time.”
